With a little bit of luck you will go home with amazing photos and a few new friends!</p> <p>We ask that you arrive on time as the group will most likely depart no later than 15 minutes after the scheduled time. If you missed the departure time then please check the comments below to see where the group went. We also ask that you be a little flexible regarding location decision as it may be a spot that you have recently visited. This event is all about getting up early and hanging out with a few other happy photographers while capturing an epic sunrise. We will not be disappointed if you choose to go elsewhere after the location has been decided.</p> <p>A few recommendations: Wear slippers but bring your shoes and leave them in the car if not needed. Consider wearing shorts that can get wet. There is a chance you could be walking in water up to your hips so use a backpack to carry all your items. Bring a headlamp or a flashlight as it will be dark while walking and setting up. Keep a rain jacket and an umbrella in your car. Bring a sturdy tripod and a remote shutter if available. A remote shutter will allow you to capture long exposures well over 30 seconds. Charge your batteries and empty your memory cards the night prior, but don't forget them in the morning! Always smile because it's going to be a great day!</p> <p>Any questions please post in the comments.</p> <p>Liability Waiver: The Oahu Photography Group and Hawaii Photography Tours assumes no responsibility, liability, and/or fees for injury, damage, loss, accident, defects, or irregularity to cameras, equipment, vehicles, persons, and/or other related categories whatsoever.

This is purely a fun event. With a list of clues, you’ll shoot photos during the day to share with the group at a party in the evening. This event will go on, rain or shine.<br/>Note that we’ll have a potluck at the party, so bring some food to share (let us know what that will be in the comments below so we don’t end up with all desserts).<br/>Here’s the short description:<br/>Part 1<br/>When: Clues are posted at 7:30 AM on Saturday, May 4; you shoot throughout the day ending at 5:00 pm.<br/>Where: Anywhere (Shoot wherever you are—doesn’t have to be in York County).<br/>Please shoot in JPG only—see why below.<br/>Part 2<br/>When you’re finished shooting, select ONE image to submit for each clue, renaming and copying it to a memory card to bring to the party so we can all see your interpretation. (Doing this correctly is extremely important! See below for details on how to do this.)<br/>Part 3<br/>When: 6:00 PM May 4, 2018<br/>Where: George Kurzik’s house (address and directions will be sent a few days before the event to those who RSVP “Yes.”)<br/>Here are the details:<br/>Part 1<br/>For a normal scavenger hunt, you find and retrieve things from a list. For a photo scavenger hunt, you take away only images of the things on the list. Plus clues don’t have to involve physical items; there might be emotions, gestures, suggestions, hints, fantasies, and events.<br/>At 7:30 AM, on the day of the Photo Scavenger Hunt, we’ll send a list of the clues to capture via email to those who RSVP Yes. We’ll also post a jpg image of the list just above the Comments on this event's web-page (also in the 2019 Scavenger Hunt album on the Photos page). You’ll have until 5:00 PM to shoot photos of as many clues as you can, anywhere you want. Your creativity is tested and exercised to the limit in this event. Kudos are gained by providing the most innovative solution to the clue.<br/>Here’s an example: For a clue of “Dinosaur,” you might shoot a child’s toy or a 1960’s gas-guzzling Cadillac. Clues are open to your interpretation.<br/>Part 2<br/>When you’re finished shooting your clues, download your images to your computer and go through them to find the one image for each clue that you’d like to share with the group. You won’t have time to enhance what you’ve taken, which is the reason to shoot in jpg. Rename each chosen image with the number of the clue and your initials. (Important!)<br/>Example: For clue #3, if your name is Ann Good, you’d rename that image “3ag.jpg.”<br/>On a memory card or USB thumb drive, create a directory (folder) &amp; name it something relevant. Copy all of your chosen images into that folder on the memory card (or USB thumb drive) and bring that to the meeting at George’s house.<br/>Part 3<br/>We’ll meet at George Kurzik’s house at 6 PM to share our results. When you arrive, you’ll hand over your memory device so Lynn can copy your images onto a computer so we can share all of our images on George’s TV while having refreshments (that we've each brought along).<br/>There are no prizes, just the adulation of the crowd. We hope to see you there!</p>",

Although there is no official entry the facility does require $50 per person to help feed the wolves and keep them healthy.</p> <p>Please let me know if you are interested so that I can firm up some dates. We will have to accept being flexible as we have to work around their production schedule.<br/>Here is the link to<br/><a href=""http://instinctforfilm.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://instinctforfilm.com/</a></p> <p>I will be detailing some other trips once I get a response to this opportunity and fix a date.

Its not too advanced but will showcase some incredible wildlife and landscapes for photo opportunities.</p> <p>We are going to get out and explore the back country wilderness and natural wonders of the West Kettle River in Carmi, BC. Our hired guide Pete will lead us off the beaten trail to some of the most picturesque locations in the area. He is an experienced hiker, and has lead many people to wonderful locations in his life. Pete is extremely knowledgeable of the area, the trees, birds, animals and the like. We can walk the trails, or do river walking - or maybe a bit of both! We'll come across wildlife in all states and YES there may be bones &amp; skeletons. A little ghoulish - but also very interesting to shoot! Whatever we do we are sure you will leave feeling uplifted, refreshed and ready to come back again!</p> <p>Getting to Carmi is not only easy it's a scenic drive - plan to stop and snap a pic or two along the way. It is 78 km (51 mi) from Kelowna on Hwy. 33. Head East up past Big White - it's about another 30 minutes once you've passed Big White. Turn left on to Smoker Road which is just after the second bridge (once you've seen the entering Beaverdell sign).</p> <p>Please plan to arrive by 7:45am at the end of Smoker Road. Park in the cul-de-sac where our guide Pete will meet us. MUST HAVE appropriate hiking gear! Footwear is important and a good all season jacket should be worn. Layers folks! It can be quite chilly and the area is known for having the widest daily temperature range - meaning it can get up to 30 during the day but early morning, and sunset will be a chilly 3.</p> <p>After we've hiked and congregated back in the cul-de-sac we can head up to the guide's plateau to relax before heading home. A special bonus: you'll have all day access to the property to explore at your leisure, relax, and take even more photographs! If we have any drone enthusiasts, the plateau is a great place to practice getting those stunning photos! They have fresh filtered Berkey water available for us and we can bring our own refreshments.</p> <p>The group rate is $60+7.80 tax per person for the 4 hour tour and we have 10 spots available. It's usually 3 hours but we are getting an extra hour in to get those shots! Since this hike has limited spots AND we are trying something new, please RSVP asap to show your interest. Fees are due April 27th - we don't require a deposit when you sign up and we'll coordinate payment and ride sharing closer to the event. Please watch for the updates.</p> <p>Please be mindful of yourself, your fellow photo walkers, your property and your surroundings at all times! Kelowna Photo-walks and its organizers are not responsible for you or your property! After the meet-up don't forget to upload up to eight of your best images.</p>",

If enough people are interested, you might even be able to get them to deliver to the beach. So check them out too!</p> <p>This year has been pretty warm. So I'm figuring the season opener may happen sooner in May than usual.<br/>So I'm going to shoot for the First weekend in May, 3 weeks before memorial day. No paying for parking, no paying for beach passes! The pre-season is great in that way... Also Bradley has the facilities, bathrooms, showers, and places to eat! I guess since this is my first trip as an organizer for this group, I'm going say we meet at 3rd Ave and Ocean Ave, in Bradley beach, under the flags, then figure out where the best waves are from there! Obviously, I'd like to get to know everyone, and I don't mind leading. Figure you should probably bring your spring wetsuit, the water temps should average between 50 and 60 degrees at this time of year! If you don't have a wetsuit, bring along a water shirt, it should be enough.<br/>I'm not limiting the size of the group, and I'm not limiting based on ability either! Bring some food and drink to share, we could kind of pot luck this thingy! Lets also plan on having dinner somewhere nearby at the end of the day! The waves are kinda small this time of year... So I'm going to bring my big foamie... If I'm wrong...great! If NOTHING is going on, and there's flat-water, we'll do some kind of beach or boardwalk walk... Looking forward to seeing you all there! Bring extra boards for any newbies who want to join us... Please put a note on the meetup if you can bring an extra board and don't mind someone else using it! The more the merrier! So see all you grommets and shredders at the event!</p>",

A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne.</p> <p>Trip Highlights:</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England<br/>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed<br/>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike<br/>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town<br/>• Explore the Seven Sisters National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>Photos - All photos were taken by the hike leader on previous trips so are the actual views that you will see from the route that you'll be hiking.</p> <p>Hike Description</p> <p>There are some iconic views on this hike and we'll get some great fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last ice age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 74 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head from here to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>Transport &amp; Meeting Point</p> <p>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:15am and leave the meeting point at 8:30am to take our transport at 8:46am.

We will take care of train tickets, logistics on the day etc, so that you can just turn up and have a great day :-)</p> <p>Cliffs - danger<br/>There are sheer drops off the cliffs and some of these soft chalk cliffs are crumbling at the edges with chunks regularly falling and no fencing in place. Please keep at least 3 metres away from the edges. If you fall, or the ground at the edge of the cliff collapses it will almost certainly be fatal.</p> <p>Cost</p> <p>The trip is £33 per person which includes the guided hike and transport from the group departure station listed at the top of this event.<br/>All events are limited to twenty-five person for a better quality of service and have a comfortable group.</p> <p>Price:<br/>- Members: £ 28<br/>- No Members: £ 33</p> <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: To reserve a place you must make the full payment, otherwise the reservation will not be accepted.</p> <p>Do not forget to click Going! and send a copy of the payment with the full name and contact telephone number of the attendees.

The advantage of coming with us is that we’ve participated in this event for the past several years and can guide you through the crowds to visit the best locations with minimal wait times. Our group often receives special perks not offered to the general public. We’ll also bring markers and stickers for people in our group to write their first name so that you can meet lots of friendly people, determine who is in our group, etc. as opposed to just attending by yourself.</p> <p>Weather: This event is partially indoors and will take place rain or shine.</p> <p>Parking: Metro, ride share (Lyft/Uber/etc.), biking, kayak, etc. to the embassies is advised. If you must drive and park know that options will be limited - just get a spot wherever you can in between your starting and ending point.</p> <p>Crowds: This is a popular event like the Cherry Blossom Festival. Don’t like lines or large groups of people? Please stay home rather than attend and complain about the crowds!</p> <p>Our Schedule: Guests are free to come along with us in a “buffet-style” event, visiting the embassies we select, or you can venture off on your own since there are over 50 sites open.

The kids race will start at 9:30am and the adults race will start at 10am. It is a great day to photograph kids and adults having fun dressed up as their favorite super heros. CASA also loves the support of our group and has used many of our members's images to help promote the race and a CASA's role in helping children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. So, grab your camera and come out and get some great images and help support a wonderful cause.</p> <p>I recommend arriving at 9am as it is fun to watch the kids gather and prepare for their race. It is a short 1k race and is over pretty quickly, so you need to be prepared. The adults run a full 5k so there are more opportunities to capture images of them. There are post race activities for the kids which provide wonderful colorful photo opps!

If you have a smart phone but rarely take photos, or take photos but want to learn more, this is the program for you!<br/>Gold Rush is a Chapter of PSA (Photographic Society of America) that has provided quarterly day-long photography programs in Sacramento for many years. In September, 2018, Gold Rush changed its format to offer photography presentations in the morning and shooting opportunities in the afternoon inspired by the morning presentation.<br/>On Saturday, May 4th, Gold Rush hosts Sean Duggan with a program on Smart Phone Creativity: Photography and Processing. Registration is at 9am, with the presentation in the morning, followed by a no-host lunch at a nearby restaurant, then an opportunity in the afternoon to practice what we learned in the morning--so bring your charged smart phone! Sean Duggan is an experienced Smart Phone photographer, with many workshops and books to his credit, and we're looking forward to a great program and shoot!<br/>The cost is $10 for the presentation and $25 for the presentation and shoot, with no charge for PSA/Gold Rush members. (You can join PSA there or online.) There is no limit on space for the presentation, but space for the shoot will be limited due to logistics, and PSA members will get priority--but at this point it looks as if there will be room for everyone. It's helpful if you sign up for the shoot by emailing [masked], or just come.<br/>You can visit the Gold Rush website at www.psagoldrush.org for more information. Looking forward to seeing you there! Sincerely, Laurie Friedman, VP Programs, PSA Gold Rush<br/>P.S. Our next program is on Saturday, October 5th, with Lewis Kemper presenting Motion Studies, so mark your calendars now!</p>",

New York architect, John Eberson conceived a design for the Loew's Theatre Corporation influenced by both Moorish and Spanish baroque structures. According to architectural historian Calder Loth, ""Loew's was considered the most up-to-date theater in the South when it opened on April 9, 1928."" Eberson was famous for having invented the ""atmospheric theater"" design in which the theater walls resembled an elegant villa or streetscape under a night sky. The Carpenter Theatre design evokes a Spanish setting with a faux sky ceiling containing stars and moving clouds. The Richmond Performing Alliance has made a special accommodation to allow RPMG to take a photographic tour of the theater. This is a very special opportunity to get some interior shots of this stunning place. There will be two tours. One at 10am and one at 11am. Due to constraints only 20 people on each tour. Bring your tripod! There is no fee for the tour, but a $10 donation is encouraged. web site: <a href=""https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter</a></p>",

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken. Camera stores and camera repair shops routinely charge $50 to $100 for a single cleaning.</p> <p>FCCP will be offering FREE sensor cleanings to FCCP Supporters. Supporters are those members that have paid their annual dues for 2018/19. If you are not yet a FCCP Supporter and would like to pay your dues and get your sensor cleaned, please visit this link.

The $20 can be paid at the door in cash, exact change please.</p> <p>Please sign up for the time slot you’d like to have your sensor cleaned. We are booking cleanings in ½ hour intervals starting at 8 AM and continuing until 11 AM. We are limiting signup to just 15 members per 30 minute period.

Im excited :)</p> <p>This session is scheduled for Saturday, May 4th 10.10am-1.10pm.<br/>It's a 3 hours long shoot with a short break in between.</p> <p>THEME:</p> <p>Natural Light Fine Art photography</p> <p>I'd love for you to feel the atmosphere in the space and capture the environment the way it is at the moment you are shooting.<br/>I don't know if the light will be soft or direct and whether it will be a sunny or rainy day. We'll be working on seeing and capturing whatever the mood the day will bring and I will have enough props and wardrobe to cover different scenarios.</p> <p>Please DO NOT bring any lights or equipment with you, just your camera/lens kit/reflector/tripod.<br/>This is one of the requirements for me to be able to rent the space for a shoot, as well as part of the theme for this shoot. It's challenging and also rewarding to keep thing as natural as possible.</p> <p>I will rent some vintage pieces to style 4-5 looks.<br/>One of the themes we'll do forsure is boho lifestyle photography + a few other themes depending on what I find in Vancouver vintage stores</p> <p>I have pastel pink hair now and the whole wardrobe colour sceme will be around pink, blue, nude, light green colours</p> <p>We can try some partial body-paint as well. I'll bring metallic colours. Since this will be a longer session I would like for everyone to think of their own idea during the shoot. Styling can be different for every participant depending on their vision.</p> <p>All the props, wardrobe and styling will be provided.</p> <p>Shooting time: around 3 hours, 4 participants maximum.</p> <p>My latest modelling/editing work:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artdecomodel/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/artdecomodel/</a><br/><a href=""https://www.modelmayhem.com/katesnig"" class=""linkified"">https://www.modelmayhem.com/katesnig</a></p> <p>FORMAT:</p> <p>If you need to achieve a certain effect or mood in the image, we will be able to discuss your ideas and I will help you achieve the desired result.</p> <p>I can help with art direction, use of light sources, composition, position of the model and angles to create a unique atmosphere in the photographs. But I would love for your to create your own images that will not look like any other in our group shoot.</p> <p>LOCATION:</p> <p><a href=""https://thisopenspace.com/spaces/3930-bright-loft-studio-on-main-st"" class=""linkified"">https://thisopenspace.com/spaces/3930-bright-loft-studio-on-main-st</a></p> <p>Main Intersection: Cambie and W Broadway<br/>I will send the exact address via private message after you sign up.</p> <p>MY CONTACT:</p> <p>Message me on Facebook (search Kate Snig) or call/text at six four seven nine seven five seven two zero one.

You cannot sell the images commercially without obtaining a separate release from the models.

Who was this woman? How had her family come to Colorado? What challenges had she faced and overcome to enroll and get a degree from CU? These and dozens of other questions set Polly on a quest that lead to her book, Remembering Lucile: A Virginia Family’s Rise from Slavery and a Legacy Forged a Mile High.</p> <p>If you are an aspiring author or researcher, there is much to gain from Polly’s perspective on the ins-and-outs of a complex research process, the archival opportunities in Colorado and beyond, why face-to-face contacts matter, how to work with acquisition editors, and the challenges you might face in the publishing process. Please join us for this fascinating discussion of a successful investigative research process.</p> <p>Polly E.

The only cost is $3 cash per adult. Kids free. At 10:30 AM we gather in front of Tierra Mia Coffee, on the corner of Broadway &amp; 20th Street. Those taking BART should go to Oakland's 19th Street BART Station and exit at the 20th Street exit and our starting point is right across the street.</p> <p>One may bring a sack lunch or buy one at Tierra Mia Coffee or about 15 minutes later at Oakland Whole Foods Market. I want at least some of our attendees to buy drinks or food at Tierra Mia and give tips so they will like us.</p> <p>Below is a link about Tierra Mia Oakland:<br/><a href=""https://www.yelp.com/biz/tierra-mia-coffee-oakland"" class=""linkified"">https://www.yelp.com/biz/tierra-mia-coffee-oakland</a></p> <p>At 10:40 AM we will walk West on 20th Street, then North on Harrison to the giant Whole Foods Market. We plan to eat lunch a little after Noon at Oakland's Morcom Rose Garden. If something such as a wedding prevents us from eating there we will eat later at the Piedmont Park.</p> <p>Our SF mansions walk is super popular. Oakland is unjustly famous for nothing but poverty and crime. However Oakland like San Francisco, has wealthy areas as well as poor ones. We will walk in some of the good places in Oakland and Piedmont. Inside Oakland is the town of Piedmont which in the 1920's had more millionaires per square mile than any other place in the USA. Piedmont used to be a city of super rich Republicans and now it is a city of ordinary rich Democrats. Piedmont looks as good as now as then. All of the mansions are still there in all of their old glory with flowers and gardens.</p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/7/0/event_22930352.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/8/5/event_22930629.jpeg"" /></p> <p>There are historic sites that we will see in Oakland such as the former home of former Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and the former home of the once famous entertainer Al Jolson, who was the star of the first talking movie. We end this 7.2 mile walk back at the 19th Street BART Station about 4:30 PM.</p> <p>If you have any questions about how to get around the Bay Area on public transportation below is a trip planner link provided by government: <a href=""http://transit.511.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://transit.511.org/</a></p> <p>I highly recommend taking BART because our starting/ending point is just across the street from 2 BART entrances. If you have to drive you will probably find free street parking in the Adams Point neighborhood, but that is not certain. Do not park in the Whole Foods Market parking lot for more than 2 hours. Oakland's street meter parking is not free on Saturdays, only on Sundays.</p> <p>Some legal disclaimers: By joining us for any event you hereby RELEASE and DISCHARGE it's organizers, hosts and participants from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action that you now have, or may have in the future, for injuries, damages, death and/or economic loss of any kind or nature, arising in whole or in part out of the activities, advice or information contained herein.

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken. Camera stores and camera repair shops routinely charge $50 to $100 for a single cleaning.</p> <p>FCCP will be offering FREE sensor cleanings to FCCP Supporters. Supporters are those members that have paid their annual dues for 2018/19. If you are not yet a FCCP Supporter and would like to pay your dues and get your sensor cleaned, please visit this link.

The $20 can be paid at the door in cash, exact change please.</p> <p>Please sign up for the time slot you’d like to have your sensor cleaned. We are booking cleanings in ½ hour intervals starting at 8 AM and continuing until 11 AM. We are limiting signup to just 15 members per 30 minute period. The cleaning takes just a few minutes and is done on a first come, first served basis for the ½ hour period. One RSVP is required for each camera. No more than 1 RSVP per ½ hour.</p> <p>Cameras must be submitted for a cleaning with the following accessories:</p> <p>1) Lens<br/>2) Fully charged battery<br/>3) Empty storage card (Compact Flash, SD or other)</p> <p>While you wait for your camera you can enjoy beverages at O’keefe’s. They offer coffe, tea, juices and soft drinks. Lunch is available starting at 11 AM.</p> <p>My Recommended Retailers</p> <p>Where you buy your gear matters.

Some clues what you heard is wrong: Adobe98 or ProPhoto is the best color (icc) profile: WRONG! sRGB color (icc) profile is the worst: WRONG! Calibrate your monitor and your workflow is color managed: WRONG! Uploading images for the web requires ______ [fill in the blank] (icc) profile: WRONG! High End / Custom print labs require _____ [fill in the blank] (icc) profile: 99.99% WRONG! I can keep going, but lets regress and presume whatever you read / heard is wrong to make the most of this one.</p> <p>Why so much wrong information? Arguably, to understand a color managed workflow requires many hours of credible education and expertise. If the educator is just regurgitating what they read on some blog that doesn't qualify as ""credible education and expertise"". Anything less is a disservice to you and wasting your money, time and effort and probably leading to worse results.</p> <p>I'm going to sum up what you need to do, and not do, in very direct and pointed steps. Just bring notepad and pen.</p> <p>This is NOT a workshop that teaches the ins and outs of each step, this is a ""do as your taught and you'll be good"" presentation. To learn more in-depth the ins and outs and setting it up yourself attend the workshop (posting soon, keep an eye out for it).</p> <p>::AGENDA::</p> <p>* New members are offered to introduce themselves and share little history on their connection to photography.</p> <p>* Gadget show and tell: Anyone, bring photography related gadgets to [briefly] explain and/or pass around.

New York architect, John Eberson conceived a design for the Loew's Theatre Corporation influenced by both Moorish and Spanish baroque structures. According to architectural historian Calder Loth, ""Loew's was considered the most up-to-date theater in the South when it opened on April 9, 1928."" Eberson was famous for having invented the ""atmospheric theater"" design in which the theater walls resembled an elegant villa or streetscape under a night sky. The Carpenter Theatre design evokes a Spanish setting with a faux sky ceiling containing stars and moving clouds. The Richmond Performing Alliance has made a special accommodation to allow RPMG to take a photographic tour of the theater. This is a very special opportunity to get some interior shots of this stunning place. There will be two tours. One at 10am and one at 11am. Due to constraints only 20 people on each tour. Bring your tripod! There is no fee for the tour, but a $10 donation is encouraged. web site: <a href=""https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter</a></p>",

Join Canon Trainer and Master Photographer, Eric Stoner, for this eye-opening workshop on mastering natural light. Against the rustic backdrop of Historic Batsto Village, Eric will show you how to work in any lighting condition and still achieve impactful portraits. In addition, you’ll get tips on working with professional models for natural poses and expressions to use in your next session.</p> <p>Knowing how to handle any lighting situation is critical, because many venues today don’t allow auxiliary lighting gear like light stands and strobes on site. Eric will show you how to sculpt the existing light on your subject and come away with the confidence to work any time of day, with or without shade, and not be forced to photograph only at the “sweet light” times of day.</p> <p>Skill Level - Beginner,Advanced Amateur,Amateur,Professional</p> <p>What's Included:<br/>Admission to Batsto Village Historic Site<br/>Four professional models<br/>Boxed lunch, waters, and snacks</p> <p>What to Bring:<br/>Bring your camera, memory cards, lenses from wide-angle to telephoto and any reflectors you may want to use.

We will work using soft natural window light at this class. Each workshop participant will be able to select from a variety of individual flowers (living), succulents (living), and feathers (artificial) to enhance their composition and lighting practice to feature a single item. No wind, no harsh sunlight.</p> <p>When photographing a still life subject, you have the opportunity to create an image rather than capturing a moment. Your photography is constructed from the background, to the subject, to the lighting. Since the subjects are inanimate objects, you can take your time to refine your exposure and light, as well as experiment with compositions. It’s a very pleasant way to enjoy your photography, and you don’t need any fancy gear.</p> <p>I want to encourage you to slow and take the time to make &amp; create a photograph when you can incorporate your own responses and style, with gently aided composition and camera setting suggestions.</p> <p>Photography techniques covered will include close up photography, balancing composition, selective focus, choosing backgrounds for simplicity and mood, the importance of point of view, B&amp;W, and more.</p> <p>Tripods will enable sharper images and these can be borrowed if you don’t have one. If you have macro capability this is ideal, but a longer zoom (up to 300mm) will give close-up shots. If you're new and just starting out, don't worry....you will learn how to use your current equipment creatively.</p> <p>This workshop is suitable for beginners and new group members.<br/>Library opens right at noon, so we will start about 12:15.</p> <p>Date: Saturday May 4, 2019<br/>Time: 12:00 - 2:30pm<br/>Fee: $25</p> <p>Location Howe Branch Library<br/>105 Schuyler Street<br/>Albany NY 12202<br/>There is off street parking.</p>",

This first class will be to teach you about the exposure triangle, how to stand and hold your camera, controlling your exposure, composing your shot, looking for unique light, separation and elevation, Street photography and the law, shutter speed, using depth of field as a tool and focusing techniques. I will hand out information sheets to take away with you after the class with an outline of all the information given on the day. All you need to bring is your camera with one lens, your camera manual booklet and a spare battery if you have one. Please bring a 50mm lens or equivalent (35mm cropped sensor, 25mm for Micro 4/3) A prime would be best but any lens capable of 50mm will do. If you do not have a lens capable of this please bring the closest lens you have. Message me if you have any questions about your lens or leave a comment. The class will cost £10 per person payable on the day. This is a class for novice street photographers but the lessons would be useful in all areas of photography. The weather forecast is cool with broken sunshine and clouds. Please come prepared for rain just in case. I will email all participants on the day with a checklist.</p>",

More information on the reception is in the press story, attached.</p> <p>exhibition at the Museum of International Folk Art, Alexander Girard: A Designer's Universe. (<a href=""http://www.internationalfolkart.org/exhibition/3815/alexander-girard-a-designer-039s-universe"" class=""linkified"">http://www.internationalfolkart.org/exhibition/3815/alexander-girard-a-designer-039s-universe</a>)</p> <p>Much aligned with our brand story, since its opening in 1999, Patina has established itself as an international destination for unique and personal discovery. Small objects of art jewelry are beautifully represented in juxtaposition to larger, sculptural objects. Somehow, the exquisite automobile photography of Patina artist, Michael Furman eloquently coalesces with that of the mixed media sculpture of other Patina artist, Betsy Youngquist.</p> <p>Through Girard's commended command of design, which had an impact on Ivan for most of his life, he was compelled early on to make decisions in design in concern to the gallery, which continue to impact the narrative of Patina as well as the immersive experience lent to our community of collectors.</p>",

The studio provides an instruction‐based painting environment in which students can choose and carry out their own assignments, exploring a variety of techniques in acrylics and/or oils* under the instructor’s guidance. Goals will be tailored to each student’s needs and skill level, with emphasis on successful concept development, composition, and development of personal style.</p> <p>The format of the class will be that of an ongoing atelier. We welcome developing artists, ages 15 and up, anytime. No previous painting experience is required. Number of sessions will be up to each student depending on their goals and projects. Students are required to provide their own materials.</p> <p>Please note we will not be covering watercolors in this course.</p> <p>Price: $15 per session.</p> <p>$120 for 10 sessions if paid up front.</p> <p>Cash/Check/Credit Card (we use the square)</p> <p>NO REFUNDS—This will encourage you to come to class.</p> <p>MATERIALS<br/>Students can begin with a basic set of materials, and add to their tool kit as needed.</p> <p>Substrates:<br/>We will be painting on canvas. Stretched canvas is preferred for formal projects, canvas sheets taped to a solid substrate are a great for exercises. Recommended canvas size for beginners is 12” x 18”.</p> <p>Brushes:<br/>Each student may require different brush sets depending on their goals. I find that it works best to pick brushes according to the painting style the student is interested in, rather than the medium. Bristle brushes work best for thick, texture-driven applications, such as impressionism or freestyle explorations. Synthetic (White or Golden Taklon) brushes are best for medium to thin paint, more suitable for figurative, realism-driven paintings. Soft hair brushes are good for very thin paint as well as dry brushing. This will all be explored in class on an individual basis as well.</p> <p>Paints set should include the following to start:<br/>Titanium White<br/>Ivory Black<br/>Cadmium Red Hue*<br/>Cadmium Yellow Hue*<br/>Phtalo Blue<br/>Phtalo Green<br/>Raw Umber</p> <p>Other pigments will be recommended on an individual basis.<br/>Note: do NOT buy, or use in class, the actual Cadmium‐pigment paint, as it is highly toxic and requires special handling. The fake one (It’ll read “Hue”) is just fine.</p> <p>Other Materials:<br/>Painter’s palette(s).<br/>Small, medium and large palette knives (plastic ok).<br/>Odorless turpentine for oil painting.<br/>Graphite Pencil<br/>Pencil Sharpener / Xacto Knife<br/>Kneaded Eraser<br/>Ruler<br/>Containers for Liquids<br/>Towels - Yellow Microfiber or Blue Shop Towels are great.</p> <p>See you in class!</p> <p>About the Instructor</p> <p>Angel Villanueva is a Pomona‐based artist painting in the Magical Realist style. He has participated in the dA Center for the Art’s exhibitions and programming for the past 15 years.

That first year, it was merely a handful of friends drinking juleps, wearing hats, eating Benedictine, and watching a race. As years passed and the party outgrew the apartment, the graphic design company Jessi, Josh, and Creighton founded, WORKSHOP, began hosting the event as a way to impart our organization’s personality and values. In 2012, Casson Rosenblatt was added to the official organizing body. Brooklyn Derby has moved to larger and larger venues and multiplied in size to over 500 revelers. But it is still lovingly held in the same spirit - good food, good drink, good people, good fun.</p>",

Para celebrar esta edición hemos decidido trasladarnos cerca de la playa, a la zona del Cabanyal, ya que empieza el buen tiempo a pesar de los chaparrones de semana santa. Todavía no hemos realizado ningún intercambio por esta zona de la ciudad y nos apetecía mucho. El lugar del intercambio es Drassanes 52 un centro cultural que abrió sus puertas hace poco más de un año.</p> <p>Como novedad en esta edición, en vez de traer la ropa unos días antes del intercambio, para poder valorarla y etiquetarla, se traerá el primer día del intercambio a las 16h. El intercambio no empezará hasta las 17h para que podamos colgar las prendas. Durante esa hora, podréis escuchar a Pilar Quintana, especialista del orden que ya ha colaborado en anteriores ediciones y que nos hablará sobre su libro “Reto de las 16 semanas para ordenarte”. Antes Josep y Cristina nos contaran brevemente lo que hacen en Drassanes 52. En cambio, si durante esa hora queréis daros una vuelta por la playa…no vamos a culparos por ello!</p> <p>Este intercambio lo hemos pensado de manera que podáis organizaros planes alrededor de la playa. Planes que hemos pensado:</p> <p>Plan sábado</p> <p>Para los que planeéis venir el sábado, en Drassanes por la mañana tienen un Taller de Desayuno Detox de[masked]h ( <a href=""http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/detox/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/detox/</a> ) . Si os interesa podéis venir al taller, comer por la zona y acercaros de nuevo a las 16h al intercambio.</p> <p>Plan domingo</p> <p>Si en cambio prefieres venir el domingo al intercambio, puedes venir de 12-14h y quedarte a la comida especial que hacen en Drassanes a las 14.30h de “Arròs del Senyoret” por 10€ ( <a href=""http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/especial-arros-del-senyoret/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/especial-arros-del-senyoret/</a> ).</p> <p>+INFO: <a href=""https://dearmarioaarmario.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/20o-intercambio-de-ropa/"" class=""linkified"">https://dearmarioaarmario.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/20o-intercambio-de-ropa/</a></p>",

This will make it so much easier for the models/creative team to just download the shots! If you have many shots you can email the models and creative team with a link to your photos. But you do need to upload at least one shot of every model you shot with here on the meetup page after the shoot!</p> <p>Plus that way I can keep track of the people that do not upload photos!</p> <p>Show them off on the facebook group page as well if you like!</p> <p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/SoCalFashionPhotoshoots/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/SoCalFashionPhotoshoots/</a></p> <p>But definitely, upload them to this meetup page!</p> <p>***PRICING***</p> <p>$20 per photographer</p> <p>I book a 1 to 2 photographers per model ratio! I overbook because I know there are flakes! I always try to have back up models and replace the models that bail on us. I, unfortunately, can not do anything about the models that bail at the last second or are no call/no shows but I do everything I can to have at least 1 model for every 2 photographers! usually, it's an even better ratio than that!</p> <p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p> <p>-Please provide your own model releases if you must have them. Models have the right to refuse to sign anything.</p> <p>- This Meetup does not do groups/rotations! I do not like to tell the photographers who to stick with and who to shoot. You are free to shoot with anyone. You do not have to shoot the models you do not want to shoot.</p> <p>-Please be friendly and courteous! While there will most likely be enough models to do one on ones just also expect to shoot the models with multiple photographers at once</p> <p>- Do not touch the models before asking. No grabbing them or placing them where you want them. Ask them if it is ok to place them where you want them before doing so.</p> <p>- No generators</p> <p>Hope to see ya there!</p> <p>Tawny</p> <p>REFUND POLICY: Meetups are like Concerts, If you have to cancel you can sell or give your ticket to someone else. I can try and help you with this but No refunds.</p>",

This evening's game features the Florida State League's Clearwater Threshers versus the Daytona Tortugas. The first pitch is scheduled for 6:30 PM. Spectrum Field is a very photographer friendly ball park. You can bring any size lens (no length restrictions, like the majors) and you can bring tripods and monopods. There is a bag size restriction, approximately 16x16x12.</p> <p>I'll be happy to give instruction on baseball photography, including the ever elusive ball on bat. I'll also be available to answer questions on fireworks photography as well.</p> <p>Field Box seats can be purchased on the Internet discounted to just $8 (Seniors and Children also $6) and parking is $3. We'll meet in the plaza around section 119 ~ 120, along the third base line.

We be getting dinner first, and then heading to the theater after we’ve eaten. We’ll be meeting at 6pm for dinner at the Skylight Diner, at 402 West 34th Street. The theater is a short walk from the diner, so there’ll be no issue getting there in time to get our seats. We’ll be catching the 8pm showing at the AMC Loews 34th Street 14 theater.</p> <p>*IMPORTANT- This movie is incredibly popular. The theater will very likely sell out. I highly recommend you buy your tickets ASAP. You also have to select your seat when you buy your ticket. I just bought mine for seat L10. If you buy yours as close to that seat as possible, you should be sitting with the group. Do not take this lightly. Buy your ticket as soon as you are able.</p> <p>After the the movie, for those who don’t wish the evening to end, we’ll grab some drinks at a nearby bar and continue our high level discourse and discussion- or just talk and stuff.</p>",

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:26 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

Organizing a bike ride for a bunch of hikers is a challenge. There are potentially so many different skill levels. I'd like for us to be able to ride together so I'm going to try to provide some guidelines to support that notion. Please do not take offense unless you are a masochist, then by all means.</p> <p>This is neither a social/ice cream ride nor a hardcore fitness ride. Meaning, you should be able to ride about 10 miles with no more than 1 SHORT break and maintain a speed of at least 10 miles an hour. If not, build up some stamina and join us next time. (I think I ride about 12 mph but am in no hurry.) If you are zoomy-zoomy bike rider, please pick another ride. This is not the venue to demonstrate your prowess.</p> <p>We will meet at Ingle's at 8:31 and head out no later than 8:45. Sorry in advance if you're late. We may be able to carpool by putting more bikes on cars with extra room on their carriers. If you're renting, certainly you can ride with someone else. I don't know if the bike rental shops are open on Sunday, but please make arrangements in advance so you don't get skunked, disappointed or delay the start of the ride.</p> <p>From Ingle's we will drive to Travelers Rest - 1 Grandview Way, Travelers Rest, SC 29690. This may not be the exact address but it's within a stone's throw of where we'll begin. We'll park by the cemetery.</p> <p>The trail is very flat with a few mild inclines. We will ride somewhere between 20 and 25 miles. The trail is easy to follow. If you want to ride less, you should be able to find your way back to the starting point without difficulty. There are restrooms along the way and places to get a drink.</p> <p>I'm sure many of you will have questions that I probably can't answer but please don't let that dissuade you from sending them to me. You probably have an abundance of suggestions as well. Please send those along. Most will be ignored.</p> <p>Helmets are requested but not required by me. I don't know what the state laws are.</p> <p>Repast afterward for those interested.</p> <p>Whiners are not welcome on this ride.</p> <p>Please be patient with everyone - me especially - since this is new territory for this meetup.</p> <p>Fun is MANDATORY!!!</p> <p>TTFN</p>",

In this one-day bootcamp, we will start from the very beginning and progress to a three light setup photographing a model. We’ll start the day off in a lecture setting covering the basics of studio lighting.</p> <p>Topics include<br/>• The different types of lighting equipment available for the studio<br/>• How to safely operate studio lighting equipment<br/>• The difference between LED, CFL and strobe technologies<br/>• A look at the different types of modifiers available – umbrellas, softboxes, etc. and how they change the look of a photo<br/>• What is sync speed and why it is important<br/>• Various methods to connect your camera to strobe lights<br/>From there we will move into a hands-on workshop environment setting up the studio and photographing a model. We will start with a one light set up and add lights one at a time to create a classic three light portrait.</p> <p>Concepts covered in the workshop are<br/>• Placement of lights to control the look of the photograph<br/>• How to use lighting modifiers to change the quality of the light<br/>• Using a light meter to improve exposure accuracy<br/>• Posing your subject for a more flattering look<br/>• Interacting with your subject to make them comfortable</p> <p>Everyone in the class will have the opportunity to photograph a model in each lighting setup. The class is limited to 10 students.</p> <p>Equipment Required<br/>• DSLR or Mirrorless camera with charged batteries<br/>• Clear Memory Cards<br/>• Any and all lenses you hope to use</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Scott is a photographer based out of Cedar Park, Texas. He has a studio in his home and runs Scott D Photography with his wife, Jennifer. Scott fell in love with photography about 10 years ago while working in Chicago and began the long journey of learning all he could. His favorite subject continues to be the concept of ""urban decay"" and his business focuses on family and children portraiture.</p> <p>Scott loves two things about photography. First, you can never learn it all. Second, the industry is brimming with other professionals willing and enthusiastic about guiding you through your next photographic adventure. Teaching has always been a passion for Scott, and he's thrilled to continue that passion.</p>",

Bring your camera, tripod, neutral density (ND) filter, and remote cable release (you can also use your timer). I have a few spare Yongnuo triggers for Canon and Nikon, and a few spare (77mm) ND filters of varying density that can be borrowed for this.</p> <p>For the ND filter, you will probably want something that's a 2 or 3-stop filter. You can go as high as a 10-stop, but shouldn't need anything beyond that.</p> <p>Models are welcome to join us. There are many places around the area that could be used for backdrops for portraits. Dress can be whatever the models like, nothing specific. We can try some photos in/near the water as well (if the weather permits). Since this is a long exposure waterfall shoot, the first 30-45 minutes or so will be for photographing waterfalls (so we aren't getting in each other's shots) and then the remainder of the time can be for whatever (waterfalls or portraits). I will have a changing tent available if models want to bring different outfits. There will not be an MUA for this. Models will be responsible for their own makeup.</p> <p>Please keep lighting equipment to a minimum. Ideally, just a flash and small diffuser or small softbox on a stand. No large softboxes. You will need to carry your equipment with you.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: Parking is VERY LIMITED at the meetup point given on the map. There is a larger parking lot but you will have to walk a bit to get to the meetup point. If need be we can maybe shuttle some people in/out from the main parking lot. Please use the address given to get right to the spot where we will be meeting (If you just put in Waterfall Glen into your GPS, it will probably put you at the wrong spot and you will have to walk a considerable amount).</p> <p>*** NOTE: Priority will be giving to those who did not attend the previous waterfall shoot(s). The organizer reserves the right to place people at the end of the wait list if they have already attended one of these.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please post a comment below. Models can add themselves. This is a free event. Please keep in mind that this is a public place so there maybe be other people present in the park/area. I am going to keep the number small and will adjust as necessary. I will probably do more of these shoots in the future if you don't get a spot for this one.</p>",

It is great fun and I'm sure we'll all enjoy the day.

We will visit two gardens: the Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens, and Cloudehill Gardens.</p> <p>The Alfred Nicholas Gardens are known for its picturesque waterfalls, water features, and iconic ornamental lake and boathouse. The gardens are operated by Parks Victoria – entry is free. A variety of native birds may be seen in the gardens including king parrots and colourful rosellas. There are ducks in the lake and kookaburras can often be heard in the treetops. There is a blend of native and exotic trees including mountain ash, ginkgoes, maples and liquid ambers. Colour is provided throughout the year by a variety of flowering exotic shrubs, bulbs and trees.</p> <p>Our second stop is Cloudehill Gardens (entry $10) – spend some time wandering around the 20 garden areas threaded through 80 year old European beech, magnolias, maples and a collection of Himalayan tree rhododendrons, all beautifully grown and a testament to the lush, moist soils of the Dandenongs. The garden is highlighted by glorious herbaceous borders which focus on two of the finest Japanese weeping maples to be seen anywhere in the world. ($10 entry fee to gardens, payable in the garden shop, on arrival).

Thus in 2017 she gathered the courage to quit her job and travel non-stop on a whirlwind solo backpacking trip across 20 countries in Europe, followed by over landing across Turkey, Iran and Central Asian countries. After returning from her 9 months of travel, although she joined back the corporate life the traveler in her still keeps going strong. She is constantly dreaming/planning of her next epic adventure which would be Central/South America in 2020.</p> <p>Her most recent travels were a 3-week trip across Myanmar and Laos. With this she has been to 41 countries till now. She also likes trekking a lot and has been to several Himalayan treks, and is planning for treks in Nepal soon.</p> <p>You can find all her published works here:</p> <p>Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/life.in.backpack/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/life.in.backpack/</a><br/>Facebook: www.facebook.com/mylifeinabackpack<br/>_______________________</p> <p>Speaker 2: Raksha - ""The Roving Heart""</p> <p>Raksha Rao is the founder and Chief Editor of The Roving Heart, a travel and adventure blog with stories from around the world.<br/>She works in the travel industry as an engineer and travels with a full-time job (Oh yes, that’s possible!)</p> <p>She is perpetually in search of the next trip, next adventure and forever aching to fly far where the sky touches the sea or get lost in the mountains!</p> <p>Be it snow trekking in the mighty Himalayan range, bungee jumping with a river view in Rishikesh, scuba diving in the clear turquoise blue waters of Maldives, deep diving in Sri Lanka, ziplining amidst the abundant forests of Thailand, high-altitude river rafting in the freezing cold rivers of Zanskar in Leh or volunteering at an Italian countryside near Rome – her propensity for new experiences is ever growing and as is her wishlist.</p> <p>You can find all her published works here:<br/>Facebook: <a href=""https://facebook.com/therovingheart"" class=""linkified"">https://facebook.com/therovingheart</a><br/>Instagram: <a href=""https://Instagram.com/therovingheart"" class=""linkified"">https://Instagram.com/therovingheart</a><br/>Twitter: twitter.com/therovingheart<br/>______________________________</p> <p>Have an amazing venue where you'd like to host the next session of Unplanned Stories?
