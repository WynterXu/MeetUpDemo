That first year, it was merely a handful of friends drinking juleps, wearing hats, eating Benedictine, and watching a race. As years passed and the party outgrew the apartment, the graphic design company Jessi, Josh, and Creighton founded, WORKSHOP, began hosting the event as a way to impart our organization’s personality and values. In 2012, Casson Rosenblatt was added to the official organizing body. Brooklyn Derby has moved to larger and larger venues and multiplied in size to over 500 revelers. But it is still lovingly held in the same spirit - good food, good drink, good people, good fun.</p>",

Please be familiar with navigating the settings on your camera at night. The location where we'll set up is not too far into the park but far enough from light pollution. The trail goes from sandy to rocky to gravel at random so bring good trail shoes. There is 0 reception but a good idea would be to download offline maps using the google app. A few people that went did that and it was great to simply go explore without fear of getting lost. There are lots of creatures roaming around like beetles, mice/rats? small scorpions, lizards, and mosquitos. Bring bug spray.

Depending on the number of people that go, we may split up the group so that there aren't too many in one area.

This will make it so much easier for the models/creative team to just download the shots! If you have many shots you can email the models and creative team with a link to your photos.

I overbook because I know there are flakes! I always try to have back up models and replace the models that bail on us. I, unfortunately, can not do anything about the models that bail at the last second or are no call/no shows but I do everything I can to have at least 1 model for every 2 photographers! usually, it's an even better ratio than that!</p> <p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p> <p>-Please provide your own model releases if you must have them. Models have the right to refuse to sign anything.</p> <p>- This Meetup does not do groups/rotations! I do not like to tell the photographers who to stick with and who to shoot. You are free to shoot with anyone. You do not have to shoot the models you do not want to shoot.</p> <p>-Please be friendly and courteous! While there will most likely be enough models to do one on ones just also expect to shoot the models with multiple photographers at once</p> <p>- Do not touch the models before asking. No grabbing them or placing them where you want them. Ask them if it is ok to place them where you want them before doing so.</p> <p>- No generators</p> <p>Hope to see ya there!</p> <p>Tawny</p> <p>REFUND POLICY: Meetups are like Concerts, If you have to cancel you can sell or give your ticket to someone else.

There is a bag size restriction, approximately 16x16x12.</p> <p>I'll be happy to give instruction on baseball photography, including the ever elusive ball on bat. I'll also be available to answer questions on fireworks photography as well.</p> <p>Field Box seats can be purchased on the Internet discounted to just $8 (Seniors and Children also $6) and parking is $3. We'll meet in the plaza around section 119 ~ 120, along the third base line. Join us for this fun evening of sports photography at Spectrum Field as we shoot the Clearwater Threshers versus the Daytona Tortugas, PLUS a spectacular fireworks display after the game!</p> <p>Don't miss this great evening of fun and excitement, RSVP NOW!</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/1/4/600_440195092.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/5/5/600_440195157.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/a/1/600_440195233.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/e/0/600_440195296.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Upcoming 2019 FCCP PhotoTours</p> <p>Ghost Towns &amp; Spring Wildflowers, Western Montana — May 2019</p> <p>Yellowstone/Tetons Wildlife with Fall Colors — September 2019</p> <p>Fall Colors &amp; Lighthouses, Acadia National Park/Portland — October 2019</p> <p>Polar Bears &amp; Northern Lights, Churchill, MB — Oct/Nov 2019</p> <p>My Recommended Retailers</p> <p>Where you buy your gear matters.

We be getting dinner first, and then heading to the theater after we’ve eaten. We’ll be meeting at 6pm for dinner at the Skylight Diner, at 402 West 34th Street. The theater is a short walk from the diner, so there’ll be no issue getting there in time to get our seats. We’ll be catching the 8pm showing at the AMC Loews 34th Street 14 theater.</p> <p>*IMPORTANT- This movie is incredibly popular. The theater will very likely sell out. I highly recommend you buy your tickets ASAP. You also have to select your seat when you buy your ticket. I just bought mine for seat L10. If you buy yours as close to that seat as possible, you should be sitting with the group. Do not take this lightly. Buy your ticket as soon as you are able.</p> <p>After the the movie, for those who don’t wish the evening to end, we’ll grab some drinks at a nearby bar and continue our high level discourse and discussion- or just talk and stuff.</p>",

Just a few minor adjustments in technique can make a huge difference in your control and proficiency. If you want to get better faster, you need to know the fundamentals of mountain biking technique. Whether you're just getting into mountain biking or have been riding for years, you'll learn some valuable tips from our Introduction to Mountain Biking skills class that is offered each month. The Introduction to Mountain Biking Skills class is held the first Saturday of each month from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm in Malibu Creek State Park. It is free of charge to all participants, and no reservations are needed. A discussion of backcountry preparedness, shared use etiquette, and simple maintenance tips precedes several skills stations. These include proper seated rider position, controlled braking and slow speed technical maneuvering, pedaling cadence/gear use, and proper riding position and technique for climbing and descending.</p> <p>Please arrive no later than 8:45 am to sign in. There is approximately five miles total of actual riding on easy to moderate trails.</p> <p>What To Bring: Mountain bike in good working condition Helmet Water High energy snack Appropriate clothing for existing conditions Helmets are mandatory for all participants.</p> <p>Directions: To get to Malibu Creek State Park, take the Ventura Freeway (101) to Calabasas, exit Las Virgenes Road/Malibu Canyon. Go south 3.5 miles. You will cross Mulholland Highway and go another 1/4 mile to the entrance to Malibu Creek State Park on the right. Just past the ranger kiosk to the left is a large gravel parking lot that runs parallel to the road. This is where the skills clinic participants meet. Do not go to the lower paved parking lot.</p>",

Both are on the Waterfall Challenge list. Death Brook Falls, also known as Secret Falls, is located along Death Brook near the hamlet of Raquette Lake, New York in the Adirondack Mountains. T he hike to the 70-foot waterfall along Death Brook Falls Trail (49A) is a brief one-third mile hike along a fairly wide footpath.</p> <p>Take the half-mile round trip hike to Buttermilk Falls in New York’s Adirondack Mountains. The short, wide waterfall is a beautiful and easy-to-reach destination on the Raquette River near Long Lake. Buttermilk Falls is one of the area’s most popular trails, and rightfully so.</p> <p>The short hike to Buttermilk Falls begins from a trailhead on North Point Road west of Long Lake and north of Blue Mountain Lake. You will be able to hear the tumbling waters of the Raquette River as soon as you step out of your vehicle, reassuring you that the waterfall is near. Follow the trail northwest over uneven but fairly level dirt ground. Cross hearty roots clinging to mossy boulders to arrive at the riverbank alongside Buttermilk Falls.</p> <p>Both are very short hikes with little or no elevation. There is a short hike we do near Blue Mountain Lake if folks are interested, It is called Castle Rock and is around 3 miles round trip with around 650 feet of ascent. it has views of Blue Mountain Lake which is really pretty. I will leave that decision to the group.</p> <p>Hiking boots, lunch or snacks, camera, filters, tripod. It can be slippery near the rocks.</p>",

Bring your camera, tripod, neutral density (ND) filter, and remote cable release (you can also use your timer). I have a few spare Yongnuo triggers for Canon and Nikon, and a few spare (77mm) ND filters of varying density that can be borrowed for this.</p> <p>For the ND filter, you will probably want something that's a 2 or 3-stop filter. You can go as high as a 10-stop, but shouldn't need anything beyond that.</p> <p>Models are welcome to join us. There are many places around the area that could be used for backdrops for portraits. Dress can be whatever the models like, nothing specific. We can try some photos in/near the water as well (if the weather permits). Since this is a long exposure waterfall shoot, the first 30-45 minutes or so will be for photographing waterfalls (so we aren't getting in each other's shots) and then the remainder of the time can be for whatever (waterfalls or portraits). I will have a changing tent available if models want to bring different outfits. There will not be an MUA for this. Models will be responsible for their own makeup.</p> <p>Please keep lighting equipment to a minimum. Ideally, just a flash and small diffuser or small softbox on a stand. No large softboxes. You will need to carry your equipment with you.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: Parking is VERY LIMITED at the meetup point given on the map. There is a larger parking lot but you will have to walk a bit to get to the meetup point. If need be we can maybe shuttle some people in/out from the main parking lot. Please use the address given to get right to the spot where we will be meeting (If you just put in Waterfall Glen into your GPS, it will probably put you at the wrong spot and you will have to walk a considerable amount).</p> <p>*** NOTE: Priority will be giving to those who did not attend the previous waterfall shoot(s). The organizer reserves the right to place people at the end of the wait list if they have already attended one of these.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please post a comment below. Models can add themselves. This is a free event. Please keep in mind that this is a public place so there maybe be other people present in the park/area. I am going to keep the number small and will adjust as necessary. I will probably do more of these shoots in the future if you don't get a spot for this one.</p>",

In this one-day bootcamp, we will start from the very beginning and progress to a three light setup photographing a model. We’ll start the day off in a lecture setting covering the basics of studio lighting.</p> <p>Topics include<br/>• The different types of lighting equipment available for the studio<br/>• How to safely operate studio lighting equipment<br/>• The difference between LED, CFL and strobe technologies<br/>• A look at the different types of modifiers available – umbrellas, softboxes, etc. and how they change the look of a photo<br/>• What is sync speed and why it is important<br/>• Various methods to connect your camera to strobe lights<br/>From there we will move into a hands-on workshop environment setting up the studio and photographing a model. We will start with a one light set up and add lights one at a time to create a classic three light portrait.</p> <p>Concepts covered in the workshop are<br/>• Placement of lights to control the look of the photograph<br/>• How to use lighting modifiers to change the quality of the light<br/>• Using a light meter to improve exposure accuracy<br/>• Posing your subject for a more flattering look<br/>• Interacting with your subject to make them comfortable</p> <p>Everyone in the class will have the opportunity to photograph a model in each lighting setup. The class is limited to 10 students.</p> <p>Equipment Required<br/>• DSLR or Mirrorless camera with charged batteries<br/>• Clear Memory Cards<br/>• Any and all lenses you hope to use</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Scott is a photographer based out of Cedar Park, Texas. He has a studio in his home and runs Scott D Photography with his wife, Jennifer. Scott fell in love with photography about 10 years ago while working in Chicago and began the long journey of learning all he could. His favorite subject continues to be the concept of ""urban decay"" and his business focuses on family and children portraiture.</p> <p>Scott loves two things about photography. First, you can never learn it all. Second, the industry is brimming with other professionals willing and enthusiastic about guiding you through your next photographic adventure. Teaching has always been a passion for Scott, and he's thrilled to continue that passion.</p>",

This exhibition will be on display May 5, 2019 - October 27, 2019.</p> <p>Alexander Girard was one of the most influential interior and textile designers of the 20th century. Alexander Girard: A Designer’s Universe is the first major retrospective on Girard’s work, organized by the Vitra Design Museum in Germany. It opens a door to his creative universe and shows his close relationships with contemporaries such as Charles &amp; Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen, Andy Warhol, Rudi Gernreich, and many others. Featured are Girard’s designs in textiles, furniture, and sculptures, as well as numerous sketches, drawings, and collages never shown before.</p> <p>Girard was also a pivotal figure in the history of the Museum of International Folk Art, donating more than 100,000 objects from his and his wife Susan’s folk art collection, and in 1981 creating the museum’s long-term, beloved exhibition Multiple Visions. Girard’s playful designs attest to a passion for colors, ornamentation, and inspirations from folk art.</p> <p>Coinciding with this traveling retrospective, the Museum of International Folk Art will enhance the visitor experience of its Girard collection exhibition, Multiple Visions, through interpretive and interactive elements designed for the 21st century.</p> <p>New Mexico residents admitted FREE the first Sunday of each month. Youth 16 and under and Museum of New Mexico Foundation members are always free.</p> <p>Photo: Design for matchboxes of the restaurant La Fonda del Sol, Alexander Girard, 1960 / Alexander Girard Estate, Vitra Design Museum.</p>",

Please update your RSVP if you can't attend.</p> <p>🙏 This special event is for members who are truly interested in deepening their understanding of mindful walking...or are curious as I am about really slowing down on the tracks and learning together how we can teach ourselves to appreciate what is going on around us, whilst walking through the Bush, noticing our movements on the tracks... and what some of the trees are ..what sounds are we hearing other than the person next to us, ..noticing our breathing..and how we can relax.. and incorporate a few basic concepts of mindfulness and the benefits it can bring for us to be present ..more aware of why walking in nature and the great outdoors is just so amazing...and for everyday living is healthier..</p> <p>🛑For this reason, photography will be discouraged for the first part of the event, so we can limit ourselves to nearby distractions..to appreciate what is happening in the present moment..More about this on the day..if you can come..</p> <p>🍃🍂Bring along your raincoat, lunch and snacks, water and grippy shoes for the trails, warm clothing for the times we stop briefly for mindfulness exercises, and carry everything in a small backpack..</p> <p>🛑🛑Carpooling- Sort this out amongst each other prior to the event.

We will visit two gardens: the Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens, and Cloudehill Gardens.</p> <p>The Alfred Nicholas Gardens are known for its picturesque waterfalls, water features, and iconic ornamental lake and boathouse. The gardens are operated by Parks Victoria – entry is free. A variety of native birds may be seen in the gardens including king parrots and colourful rosellas. There are ducks in the lake and kookaburras can often be heard in the treetops. There is a blend of native and exotic trees including mountain ash, ginkgoes, maples and liquid ambers. Colour is provided throughout the year by a variety of flowering exotic shrubs, bulbs and trees.</p> <p>Our second stop is Cloudehill Gardens (entry $10) – spend some time wandering around the 20 garden areas threaded through 80 year old European beech, magnolias, maples and a collection of Himalayan tree rhododendrons, all beautifully grown and a testament to the lush, moist soils of the Dandenongs. The garden is highlighted by glorious herbaceous borders which focus on two of the finest Japanese weeping maples to be seen anywhere in the world. ($10 entry fee to gardens, payable in the garden shop, on arrival). Feel free to visit the Diggers Nursery and retail shop.</p> <p>Bring a tripod if you would like to do some macro photography.</p> <p>We will conclude with drinks/dinner at a local pub at the end of the day.</p> <p>All visitors, friends and members of the Melbourne Camera Club are welcome.</p> <p>Please allow a little extra time for car parking if the gardens are busy – there are designated car parks at each garden, but also plenty of parking on the side of the road.</p> <p>Date: Sunday 5 May<br/>Time: 1.00pm for a 1.15pm start<br/>Meeting Location: Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens, 1A Sherbrooke Rd, Sherbrooke – meet inside main gate<br/>Duration: 4 hours, plus dinner<br/>Cost: $10.00 garden entry for Cloudehill Gardens (Free entry at Alfred Nicholas Gardens)</p> <p>Image: Sally Paterson <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sallyp_melb/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/sallyp_melb/</a></p>",

Kurz zum Zeitplan: 15 Uhr Treffen am Gänsturm, bis ca. 17 Uhr Rundgang durch Ulm/Neu-Ulm, entlang der Donau, ins Fischerviertel und zum Münster, ab ca. 17 Uhr Austausch über gemachte Fotos im Stadthaus.

If we find there is interest, we will continue this on a weekly basis.</p> <p>We would like the submitted image to be shot during the week of the assignment, however, feel free to upload an applicable photo from your archive and include the words ""From my Archive"" in the Caption or First Comment.</p> <p>Remember, if you are interested in feedback from other members, be sure to also include ""Feedback Requested"" in the Comments. Those commenting will provide a brief positive note on what compositional element they like as well as what they believe can further enhance the photo.</p> <p>Here are a few ""Golden Hour"" photos to get you thinking.

There are several locations for landscape photos that we can take in the golden hours, on a cloudy day, or at night. Some of the places we can photograph are the Bodie Lighthouse (We'll make several trips to this location for sunrise or sunset, and on a clear night with the Milky Way), Nags Head Pier (perfect for morning/evening, stormy days and at night), Pea Island Wildlife Refuge, Jannette’s Pier, Coquina beach, and Jockey’s Ridge State Park. There are two refuges within 30 minutes of Nags Head that house a robust amount of wildlife from black bears and wolves to neotripocal songbirds and snakes. We will attempt to visit both of these refuges: Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>Recommended gear/equipment: wide angle lens, filters such as ND and Polarizing filter, sturdy tripod, telephoto lens and possibly your macro lens. The beach can be damaging to photography equipment. I've learned the hard way not to collapse the legs of my tripod before washing them off. Also, make sure you have a lens cleaner and a cloth to wipe off sea spray. A red light and head lamp are always good to have when shooting at night.</p> <p>Tips:<br/>The refuges are filled with creepy, crawly insects and reptiles, so be sure to wear appropriate clothing such as boots, gaiters, long pants, and a hat. I highly recommend that you download the maps of the area (in particular the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge) onto your phone so you can access them when you don't have a cell phone signal (the refuge is quite large and the roads can be confusing).<br/>------------------<br/>Please view/download the following PDFs from DropBox to find more information about our schedule, points of interest, accommodations, and dining.<br/>Schedule: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/7frmm2gu3etp5m3/Schedule-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7frmm2gu3etp5m3/Schedule-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Points of Interest: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ho6b2jffia2aj2/PointsofInterest-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ho6b2jffia2aj2/PointsofInterest-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Accommodations: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/565fd294ncabqec/Accommodations-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/565fd294ncabqec/Accommodations-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Dining: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3mrdrxcun9lq2/Dining-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3mrdrxcun9lq2/Dining-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a></p> <p>A little bit about Nags Head and surrounding areas:<br/>Nags Head is arguably one of the Outer Banks' most established tourism destinations, and the area remains popular with visitors today for its wealth of amenities, sprawling ocean and soundfront views, and classic Outer Banks style. In Nags Head, a beach-loving vacationer can find virtually anything to make an OBX vacation perfect, including some of the area's favorite restaurants, natural and historical attractions, and miles of fun. Visitors come here year after year for the fantastic Outer Banks beaches and ample entertainment, and have been doing so for generations. An ideal mix of on-the-beach relaxation and off-the-beach amusements, Nags Head remains one of the Outer Banks' most loved vacation destinations.<br/>----------------<br/>Useful Links:<br/>Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge: <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Pea_Island/visit/plan_your_visit.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Pea_Island/visit/plan_your_visit.html</a><br/>Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge: <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/seasons_of_wildlife/index.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/seasons_of_wildlife/index.html</a><br/>Jockey’s Ridge State Park: <a href=""https://www.ncparks.gov/jockeys-ridge-state-park"" class=""linkified"">https://www.ncparks.gov/jockeys-ridge-state-park</a><br/>Outer Banks.com: <a href=""https://www.outerbanks.com/nags-head.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.outerbanks.com/nags-head.html</a></p> <p>---------------<br/>Please read our disclaimer for this event in the link below.

The band lends it’s geeky charm to performing 80’s hits complete with “nerdography” and “spaztic” movements. They add a unique dimension to their performance, demonstrating the common ties between '80s new wave and today’s popular music.In addition to a recently filmed national commercial for Comcast, The Spazmatics have been regularly featured at top nightclubs and perform for many of the highest level private events in the United States, including a recent performance at The White House for President George W.

This workshop will get you well on your way to making beautiful portraits using OCF. Topics include:</p> <p>- Location scouting with good light and surroundings</p> <p>- Understanding focal length for portraits</p> <p>- Light quality and direction</p> <p>- Equipment considerations</p> <p>- Blending flash with available light</p> <p>- How to separate a subject from the background</p> <p>- Posing and how to make it work outdoors</p> <p>We will cover this material in-depth then shoot at several spots at the park. You'll have plenty of time to shoot and explore the combinations of light, location and pose. I'll bring a flash that works with Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, Panasonic and Fuji in TTL as well as HSS. If you're not familiar with those terms, you'll learn all about them in this workshop. You'll definitely want to bring your camera because you will be shooting during this workshop. I will provide the flash - you do not need to bring your own flash. Once you get the hang of using OCF outdoors, you'll see it's not difficult and can make a dramatic difference in your images.</p> <p>We'll be joined by a professional model so you will be able to practice what you learn.</p> <p>Your enrollment includes photo release for promotional/portfolio use so you'll not only learn about outdoor photography but you'll also have the opportunity to add to your portfolio.</p> <p>Plan on wearing comfortable walking shoes for this workshop. At times, we may walk on uneven, rocky surfaces.</p> <p>Please check your camera's firmware to ensure it is up-to-date. We've had a few people have technical issues at past workshops due to out-of-date firmware. If you would like to attend this workshop and need help updating your firmware send me a private message.</p>",

You can find opportunities to practice silhouettes during most sunrises and sunsets, though many opprtunities can present themselves throughout the day so long as the background of the subject is bright, and you fucus on the light area for metering purposes, and then recompose. It is beneficial to user higher f stops like f11 or higher, but that is not a hard fast rule.</p> <p>It’s a genre of photography usually done candidly without permission and without your subject’s knowledge. However, silhouettes doesn’t rule out staged pictures. You may spot an interesting person or shape that catches your vision, and try to eexperiment with exposure compensation and bracketing.</p> <p>Here is a good good URL to get a better idea how to capture silhouettes</p> <p><a href=""https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/"" class=""linkified"">https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/</a></p> <p>The deadline is Sunday May 5th - 8:00 pm. Remember only one entry per person. Bob will have a vote in this weeks theme, with the caveat of not voting for his entry. Remember the photo must be taken this week, no archive digging!</p> <p>Lets see what we can capture with this great theme!</p> <p>Jake, Jimmy and Brian</p>",

It happens to everyone. We all want to take good, hopefully great shots but sometimes our camera fails to capture what we thought that we saw. The resulting photo is lacking somehow. Perhaps the composition is off, or the colours not as vibrant as you remembered. You may want the shot to work but may not know what is needed to make it work. This is where Photo Critique comes in.</p> <p>How does it work? Members post a photograph and describe what they had hoped to achieve when they took the shot. Other members look at the photo, read the description and then comment on what could have been done differently or what they would do in post processing to achieve a better result.</p> <p>Ignore Calendar settings--this will stay open all year</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>A desire to help others and a willingness to offer advice in a friendly way. Comments should be made in a non confrontational way. We can all learn and learning is always better in a environment conducive to learning. Be nice!<br/>Also--and this is very important take others thoughts and comments in a positive way. At the end of the day It is your photo and you will see things differently. You can learn from others perspectives however.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>If in doubt about what is posted in comments ask the photographer to clarify--start a discussion and then hopefully others will join in.</p>",

[This could go on for about an hour]. Then each person will read / study whatever they like, on their own. There is no official end time for this event. The point is to dedicate some time to reading, together in a relaxing set-up. This is important for us as we are mostly busy people who may not have enough of a chance to dedicate time to reading during the week.</p> <p>The main language of the event is English, however we usually have people who speak various languages, so it's possible to get help if you're trying to read a book in a language that you're learning.</p> <p>I've put this event on auto-repeat as we organise it pretty regularly, but please note that it will only take place if enough members have signed up. If you'd like to make sure that the event takes place, please RSVP before Tuesday as that's when I'll decide whether the event takes place that week.</p> <p>Our usual instructions / coc apply to this event.

But because so many of you enjoy it, we knew we couldn’t just skip your recurring opportunity to be horrible. I'm sure we're doing a great service providing a safe outlet for these urges, even if a little later than usual.</p> <p>We'll be playing at The Uncommons (<a href=""http://www.uncommonsnyc.com"" class=""linkified"">http://www.uncommonsnyc.com</a>), a tabletop gaming cafe. If by any chance Cards Against Humanity isn't your thing, they literally have a menu (<a href=""http://www.uncommonsnyc.com/games/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.uncommonsnyc.com/games/</a>) of dozens of games for you to enjoy, along with more typical menus for things like food and drink. For the small fee of $7 plus tax, all of these things will be available to you for the entire evening (The games, not the food and drink).</p> <p>So come out and enjoy the guilty pleasure of being acceptably horrible with a card game, or play another game and sit in quiet judgment of the rest of us (both options have their appeal). Either way, join us for some fun games and good company this weekend.</p>",
