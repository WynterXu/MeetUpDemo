That first year, it was merely a handful of friends drinking juleps, wearing hats, eating Benedictine, and watching a race. As years passed and the party outgrew the apartment, the graphic design company Jessi, Josh, and Creighton founded, WORKSHOP, began hosting the event as a way to impart our organization’s personality and values. In 2012, Casson Rosenblatt was added to the official organizing body. Brooklyn Derby has moved to larger and larger venues and multiplied in size to over 500 revelers. But it is still lovingly held in the same spirit - good food, good drink, good people, good fun.</p>",

I overbook because I know there are flakes! I always try to have back up models and replace the models that bail on us. I, unfortunately, can not do anything about the models that bail at the last second or are no call/no shows but I do everything I can to have at least 1 model for every 2 photographers! usually, it's an even better ratio than that!</p> <p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p> <p>-Please provide your own model releases if you must have them. Models have the right to refuse to sign anything.</p> <p>- This Meetup does not do groups/rotations! I do not like to tell the photographers who to stick with and who to shoot. You are free to shoot with anyone. You do not have to shoot the models you do not want to shoot.</p> <p>-Please be friendly and courteous! While there will most likely be enough models to do one on ones just also expect to shoot the models with multiple photographers at once</p> <p>- Do not touch the models before asking. No grabbing them or placing them where you want them. Ask them if it is ok to place them where you want them before doing so.</p> <p>- No generators</p> <p>Hope to see ya there!</p> <p>Tawny</p> <p>REFUND POLICY: Meetups are like Concerts, If you have to cancel you can sell or give your ticket to someone else.

There is a bag size restriction, approximately 16x16x12.</p> <p>I'll be happy to give instruction on baseball photography, including the ever elusive ball on bat. I'll also be available to answer questions on fireworks photography as well.</p> <p>Field Box seats can be purchased on the Internet discounted to just $8 (Seniors and Children also $6) and parking is $3. We'll meet in the plaza around section 119 ~ 120, along the third base line. Join us for this fun evening of sports photography at Spectrum Field as we shoot the Clearwater Threshers versus the Daytona Tortugas, PLUS a spectacular fireworks display after the game!</p> <p>Don't miss this great evening of fun and excitement, RSVP NOW!</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/1/4/600_440195092.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/5/5/600_440195157.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/a/1/600_440195233.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/e/0/600_440195296.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Upcoming 2019 FCCP PhotoTours</p> <p>Ghost Towns &amp; Spring Wildflowers, Western Montana — May 2019</p> <p>Yellowstone/Tetons Wildlife with Fall Colors — September 2019</p> <p>Fall Colors &amp; Lighthouses, Acadia National Park/Portland — October 2019</p> <p>Polar Bears &amp; Northern Lights, Churchill, MB — Oct/Nov 2019</p> <p>My Recommended Retailers</p> <p>Where you buy your gear matters.

I highly recommend you buy your tickets ASAP. You also have to select your seat when you buy your ticket. I just bought mine for seat L10. If you buy yours as close to that seat as possible, you should be sitting with the group. Do not take this lightly. Buy your ticket as soon as you are able.</p> <p>After the the movie, for those who don’t wish the evening to end, we’ll grab some drinks at a nearby bar and continue our high level discourse and discussion- or just talk and stuff.</p>",

Just a few minor adjustments in technique can make a huge difference in your control and proficiency. If you want to get better faster, you need to know the fundamentals of mountain biking technique. Whether you're just getting into mountain biking or have been riding for years, you'll learn some valuable tips from our Introduction to Mountain Biking skills class that is offered each month. The Introduction to Mountain Biking Skills class is held the first Saturday of each month from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm in Malibu Creek State Park. It is free of charge to all participants, and no reservations are needed. A discussion of backcountry preparedness, shared use etiquette, and simple maintenance tips precedes several skills stations. These include proper seated rider position, controlled braking and slow speed technical maneuvering, pedaling cadence/gear use, and proper riding position and technique for climbing and descending.</p> <p>Please arrive no later than 8:45 am to sign in. There is approximately five miles total of actual riding on easy to moderate trails.</p> <p>What To Bring: Mountain bike in good working condition Helmet Water High energy snack Appropriate clothing for existing conditions Helmets are mandatory for all participants.</p> <p>Directions: To get to Malibu Creek State Park, take the Ventura Freeway (101) to Calabasas, exit Las Virgenes Road/Malibu Canyon. Go south 3.5 miles. You will cross Mulholland Highway and go another 1/4 mile to the entrance to Malibu Creek State Park on the right. Just past the ranger kiosk to the left is a large gravel parking lot that runs parallel to the road. This is where the skills clinic participants meet. Do not go to the lower paved parking lot.</p>",

Both are on the Waterfall Challenge list. Death Brook Falls, also known as Secret Falls, is located along Death Brook near the hamlet of Raquette Lake, New York in the Adirondack Mountains. T he hike to the 70-foot waterfall along Death Brook Falls Trail (49A) is a brief one-third mile hike along a fairly wide footpath.</p> <p>Take the half-mile round trip hike to Buttermilk Falls in New York’s Adirondack Mountains. The short, wide waterfall is a beautiful and easy-to-reach destination on the Raquette River near Long Lake. Buttermilk Falls is one of the area’s most popular trails, and rightfully so.</p> <p>The short hike to Buttermilk Falls begins from a trailhead on North Point Road west of Long Lake and north of Blue Mountain Lake. You will be able to hear the tumbling waters of the Raquette River as soon as you step out of your vehicle, reassuring you that the waterfall is near. Follow the trail northwest over uneven but fairly level dirt ground. Cross hearty roots clinging to mossy boulders to arrive at the riverbank alongside Buttermilk Falls.</p> <p>Both are very short hikes with little or no elevation. There is a short hike we do near Blue Mountain Lake if folks are interested, It is called Castle Rock and is around 3 miles round trip with around 650 feet of ascent. it has views of Blue Mountain Lake which is really pretty. I will leave that decision to the group.</p> <p>Hiking boots, lunch or snacks, camera, filters, tripod. It can be slippery near the rocks.</p>",

Bring your camera, tripod, neutral density (ND) filter, and remote cable release (you can also use your timer). I have a few spare Yongnuo triggers for Canon and Nikon, and a few spare (77mm) ND filters of varying density that can be borrowed for this.</p> <p>For the ND filter, you will probably want something that's a 2 or 3-stop filter. You can go as high as a 10-stop, but shouldn't need anything beyond that.</p> <p>Models are welcome to join us. There are many places around the area that could be used for backdrops for portraits. Dress can be whatever the models like, nothing specific. We can try some photos in/near the water as well (if the weather permits). Since this is a long exposure waterfall shoot, the first 30-45 minutes or so will be for photographing waterfalls (so we aren't getting in each other's shots) and then the remainder of the time can be for whatever (waterfalls or portraits). I will have a changing tent available if models want to bring different outfits. There will not be an MUA for this. Models will be responsible for their own makeup.</p> <p>Please keep lighting equipment to a minimum. Ideally, just a flash and small diffuser or small softbox on a stand. No large softboxes. You will need to carry your equipment with you.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: Parking is VERY LIMITED at the meetup point given on the map. There is a larger parking lot but you will have to walk a bit to get to the meetup point. If need be we can maybe shuttle some people in/out from the main parking lot. Please use the address given to get right to the spot where we will be meeting (If you just put in Waterfall Glen into your GPS, it will probably put you at the wrong spot and you will have to walk a considerable amount).</p> <p>*** NOTE: Priority will be giving to those who did not attend the previous waterfall shoot(s). The organizer reserves the right to place people at the end of the wait list if they have already attended one of these.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please post a comment below. Models can add themselves. This is a free event. Please keep in mind that this is a public place so there maybe be other people present in the park/area. I am going to keep the number small and will adjust as necessary. I will probably do more of these shoots in the future if you don't get a spot for this one.</p>",

In this one-day bootcamp, we will start from the very beginning and progress to a three light setup photographing a model. We’ll start the day off in a lecture setting covering the basics of studio lighting.</p> <p>Topics include<br/>• The different types of lighting equipment available for the studio<br/>• How to safely operate studio lighting equipment<br/>• The difference between LED, CFL and strobe technologies<br/>• A look at the different types of modifiers available – umbrellas, softboxes, etc. and how they change the look of a photo<br/>• What is sync speed and why it is important<br/>• Various methods to connect your camera to strobe lights<br/>From there we will move into a hands-on workshop environment setting up the studio and photographing a model. We will start with a one light set up and add lights one at a time to create a classic three light portrait.</p> <p>Concepts covered in the workshop are<br/>• Placement of lights to control the look of the photograph<br/>• How to use lighting modifiers to change the quality of the light<br/>• Using a light meter to improve exposure accuracy<br/>• Posing your subject for a more flattering look<br/>• Interacting with your subject to make them comfortable</p> <p>Everyone in the class will have the opportunity to photograph a model in each lighting setup. The class is limited to 10 students.</p> <p>Equipment Required<br/>• DSLR or Mirrorless camera with charged batteries<br/>• Clear Memory Cards<br/>• Any and all lenses you hope to use</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Scott is a photographer based out of Cedar Park, Texas. He has a studio in his home and runs Scott D Photography with his wife, Jennifer. Scott fell in love with photography about 10 years ago while working in Chicago and began the long journey of learning all he could. His favorite subject continues to be the concept of ""urban decay"" and his business focuses on family and children portraiture.</p> <p>Scott loves two things about photography. First, you can never learn it all. Second, the industry is brimming with other professionals willing and enthusiastic about guiding you through your next photographic adventure. Teaching has always been a passion for Scott, and he's thrilled to continue that passion.</p>",

This exhibition will be on display May 5, 2019 - October 27, 2019.</p> <p>Alexander Girard was one of the most influential interior and textile designers of the 20th century. Alexander Girard: A Designer’s Universe is the first major retrospective on Girard’s work, organized by the Vitra Design Museum in Germany. It opens a door to his creative universe and shows his close relationships with contemporaries such as Charles &amp; Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen, Andy Warhol, Rudi Gernreich, and many others. Featured are Girard’s designs in textiles, furniture, and sculptures, as well as numerous sketches, drawings, and collages never shown before.</p> <p>Girard was also a pivotal figure in the history of the Museum of International Folk Art, donating more than 100,000 objects from his and his wife Susan’s folk art collection, and in 1981 creating the museum’s long-term, beloved exhibition Multiple Visions. Girard’s playful designs attest to a passion for colors, ornamentation, and inspirations from folk art.</p> <p>Coinciding with this traveling retrospective, the Museum of International Folk Art will enhance the visitor experience of its Girard collection exhibition, Multiple Visions, through interpretive and interactive elements designed for the 21st century.</p> <p>New Mexico residents admitted FREE the first Sunday of each month.

Passejarem pels carrers de la ciutat a la recerca de les coses que ens puguin agradar, interessar, sorprendre, anirem a la recerca de la bellesa. Al mateix temps, la trobada també ens permetrà conèixer gent amb la mateixa afició que nosaltres i podrem intercanviar idees, impressions i coneixements. No cal portar un gran equip, n’hi haurà prou amb una càmera petita que ens permeti passar desapercebuts i no ser gaire invasius.

The gardens are operated by Parks Victoria – entry is free. A variety of native birds may be seen in the gardens including king parrots and colourful rosellas. There are ducks in the lake and kookaburras can often be heard in the treetops. There is a blend of native and exotic trees including mountain ash, ginkgoes, maples and liquid ambers. Colour is provided throughout the year by a variety of flowering exotic shrubs, bulbs and trees.</p> <p>Our second stop is Cloudehill Gardens (entry $10) – spend some time wandering around the 20 garden areas threaded through 80 year old European beech, magnolias, maples and a collection of Himalayan tree rhododendrons, all beautifully grown and a testament to the lush, moist soils of the Dandenongs. The garden is highlighted by glorious herbaceous borders which focus on two of the finest Japanese weeping maples to be seen anywhere in the world. ($10 entry fee to gardens, payable in the garden shop, on arrival). Feel free to visit the Diggers Nursery and retail shop.</p> <p>Bring a tripod if you would like to do some macro photography.</p> <p>We will conclude with drinks/dinner at a local pub at the end of the day.</p> <p>All visitors, friends and members of the Melbourne Camera Club are welcome.</p> <p>Please allow a little extra time for car parking if the gardens are busy – there are designated car parks at each garden, but also plenty of parking on the side of the road.</p> <p>Date: Sunday 5 May<br/>Time: 1.00pm for a 1.15pm start<br/>Meeting Location: Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens, 1A Sherbrooke Rd, Sherbrooke – meet inside main gate<br/>Duration: 4 hours, plus dinner<br/>Cost: $10.00 garden entry for Cloudehill Gardens (Free entry at Alfred Nicholas Gardens)</p> <p>Image: Sally Paterson <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sallyp_melb/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/sallyp_melb/</a></p>",

Kurz zum Zeitplan: 15 Uhr Treffen am Gänsturm, bis ca. 17 Uhr Rundgang durch Ulm/Neu-Ulm, entlang der Donau, ins Fischerviertel und zum Münster, ab ca. 17 Uhr Austausch über gemachte Fotos im Stadthaus.

There are two refuges within 30 minutes of Nags Head that house a robust amount of wildlife from black bears and wolves to neotripocal songbirds and snakes. We will attempt to visit both of these refuges: Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>Recommended gear/equipment: wide angle lens, filters such as ND and Polarizing filter, sturdy tripod, telephoto lens and possibly your macro lens. The beach can be damaging to photography equipment. I've learned the hard way not to collapse the legs of my tripod before washing them off. Also, make sure you have a lens cleaner and a cloth to wipe off sea spray. A red light and head lamp are always good to have when shooting at night.</p> <p>Tips:<br/>The refuges are filled with creepy, crawly insects and reptiles, so be sure to wear appropriate clothing such as boots, gaiters, long pants, and a hat. I highly recommend that you download the maps of the area (in particular the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge) onto your phone so you can access them when you don't have a cell phone signal (the refuge is quite large and the roads can be confusing).<br/>------------------<br/>Please view/download the following PDFs from DropBox to find more information about our schedule, points of interest, accommodations, and dining.<br/>Schedule: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/7frmm2gu3etp5m3/Schedule-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7frmm2gu3etp5m3/Schedule-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Points of Interest: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ho6b2jffia2aj2/PointsofInterest-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ho6b2jffia2aj2/PointsofInterest-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Accommodations: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/565fd294ncabqec/Accommodations-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/565fd294ncabqec/Accommodations-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Dining: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3mrdrxcun9lq2/Dining-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3mrdrxcun9lq2/Dining-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a></p> <p>A little bit about Nags Head and surrounding areas:<br/>Nags Head is arguably one of the Outer Banks' most established tourism destinations, and the area remains popular with visitors today for its wealth of amenities, sprawling ocean and soundfront views, and classic Outer Banks style. In Nags Head, a beach-loving vacationer can find virtually anything to make an OBX vacation perfect, including some of the area's favorite restaurants, natural and historical attractions, and miles of fun. Visitors come here year after year for the fantastic Outer Banks beaches and ample entertainment, and have been doing so for generations. An ideal mix of on-the-beach relaxation and off-the-beach amusements, Nags Head remains one of the Outer Banks' most loved vacation destinations.<br/>----------------<br/>Useful Links:<br/>Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge: <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Pea_Island/visit/plan_your_visit.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Pea_Island/visit/plan_your_visit.html</a><br/>Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge: <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/seasons_of_wildlife/index.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/seasons_of_wildlife/index.html</a><br/>Jockey’s Ridge State Park: <a href=""https://www.ncparks.gov/jockeys-ridge-state-park"" class=""linkified"">https://www.ncparks.gov/jockeys-ridge-state-park</a><br/>Outer Banks.com: <a href=""https://www.outerbanks.com/nags-head.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.outerbanks.com/nags-head.html</a></p> <p>---------------<br/>Please read our disclaimer for this event in the link below.

The band lends it’s geeky charm to performing 80’s hits complete with “nerdography” and “spaztic” movements. They add a unique dimension to their performance, demonstrating the common ties between '80s new wave and today’s popular music.In addition to a recently filmed national commercial for Comcast, The Spazmatics have been regularly featured at top nightclubs and perform for many of the highest level private events in the United States, including a recent performance at The White House for President George W.

This workshop will get you well on your way to making beautiful portraits using OCF. Topics include:</p> <p>- Location scouting with good light and surroundings</p> <p>- Understanding focal length for portraits</p> <p>- Light quality and direction</p> <p>- Equipment considerations</p> <p>- Blending flash with available light</p> <p>- How to separate a subject from the background</p> <p>- Posing and how to make it work outdoors</p> <p>We will cover this material in-depth then shoot at several spots at the park. You'll have plenty of time to shoot and explore the combinations of light, location and pose. I'll bring a flash that works with Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, Panasonic and Fuji in TTL as well as HSS. If you're not familiar with those terms, you'll learn all about them in this workshop. You'll definitely want to bring your camera because you will be shooting during this workshop. I will provide the flash - you do not need to bring your own flash. Once you get the hang of using OCF outdoors, you'll see it's not difficult and can make a dramatic difference in your images.</p> <p>We'll be joined by a professional model so you will be able to practice what you learn.</p> <p>Your enrollment includes photo release for promotional/portfolio use so you'll not only learn about outdoor photography but you'll also have the opportunity to add to your portfolio.</p> <p>Plan on wearing comfortable walking shoes for this workshop. At times, we may walk on uneven, rocky surfaces.</p> <p>Please check your camera's firmware to ensure it is up-to-date. We've had a few people have technical issues at past workshops due to out-of-date firmware. If you would like to attend this workshop and need help updating your firmware send me a private message.</p>",

I'll be helping everyone individually and answering any questions that arise.</p> <p>WHAT TO BRING</p> <p>Your camera of course, any kind of camera is fine as long as it has MANUAL settings. If you only have a phone as your camera, you probably won't benefit too much from this session.</p> <p>Please bring your instruction manual is possible.

You can find opportunities to practice silhouettes during most sunrises and sunsets, though many opprtunities can present themselves throughout the day so long as the background of the subject is bright, and you fucus on the light area for metering purposes, and then recompose. It is beneficial to user higher f stops like f11 or higher, but that is not a hard fast rule.</p> <p>It’s a genre of photography usually done candidly without permission and without your subject’s knowledge. However, silhouettes doesn’t rule out staged pictures. You may spot an interesting person or shape that catches your vision, and try to eexperiment with exposure compensation and bracketing.</p> <p>Here is a good good URL to get a better idea how to capture silhouettes</p> <p><a href=""https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/"" class=""linkified"">https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/</a></p> <p>The deadline is Sunday May 5th - 8:00 pm. Remember only one entry per person. Bob will have a vote in this weeks theme, with the caveat of not voting for his entry. Remember the photo must be taken this week, no archive digging!</p> <p>Lets see what we can capture with this great theme!</p> <p>Jake, Jimmy and Brian</p>",

[This could go on for about an hour]. Then each person will read / study whatever they like, on their own. There is no official end time for this event. The point is to dedicate some time to reading, together in a relaxing set-up. This is important for us as we are mostly busy people who may not have enough of a chance to dedicate time to reading during the week.</p> <p>The main language of the event is English, however we usually have people who speak various languages, so it's possible to get help if you're trying to read a book in a language that you're learning.</p> <p>I've put this event on auto-repeat as we organise it pretty regularly, but please note that it will only take place if enough members have signed up. If you'd like to make sure that the event takes place, please RSVP before Tuesday as that's when I'll decide whether the event takes place that week.</p> <p>Our usual instructions / coc apply to this event. Please make sure to read them. <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Nerds-And-Friends/messages/boards/thread/50476274/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.meetup.com/Nerds-And-Friends/messages/boards/thread/50476274/</a></p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>A+</p>",

It happens to everyone. We all want to take good, hopefully great shots but sometimes our camera fails to capture what we thought that we saw. The resulting photo is lacking somehow. Perhaps the composition is off, or the colours not as vibrant as you remembered. You may want the shot to work but may not know what is needed to make it work. This is where Photo Critique comes in.</p> <p>How does it work? Members post a photograph and describe what they had hoped to achieve when they took the shot. Other members look at the photo, read the description and then comment on what could have been done differently or what they would do in post processing to achieve a better result.</p> <p>Ignore Calendar settings--this will stay open all year</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>A desire to help others and a willingness to offer advice in a friendly way. Comments should be made in a non confrontational way. We can all learn and learning is always better in a environment conducive to learning. Be nice!<br/>Also--and this is very important take others thoughts and comments in a positive way. At the end of the day It is your photo and you will see things differently. You can learn from others perspectives however.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>If in doubt about what is posted in comments ask the photographer to clarify--start a discussion and then hopefully others will join in.</p>",

This event detailed below, however, is for an actual meetup and will be taking place on the dates shown.</p> <p>This is an open photography trip to Glencoe to allow members to take the type of shots that are impossible to do on our Thursday afternoon jaunts. While it is nominally for three-nights members can choose how long they would like to go for and where they would like to stay. For campers, I would suggest booking Invercoe campsite, <a href=""http://www.invercoe.co.uk"" class=""linkified"">http://www.invercoe.co.uk</a>. Cottages, Lodges and Caravans are also available for hire from their website. Micro pods are also available from <a href=""https://www.invercoe.co.uk/micro-lodges-in-glencoe/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.invercoe.co.uk/micro-lodges-in-glencoe/</a>, as are the regular hotels and BBs.</p> <p>Glencoe was chosen for this first trip as there is a great variety of accommodation available in the area and it is a spectacular location.<br/>Everyone will be responsible for booking their own accommodation, though it may be an idea to team up with someone if you are looking to rent a pod or Cottage. Once we know all who are going we can work out lifts for those who require them.</p> <p>As the group is very much one for free spirits, no rules, there would none the less be a morning/evening meetup​ each day at a suitable location where options could be discussed for photographic trips for that day. Members would then be free to go off with others or on their own. Weather depending, arrangements could also be made to photograph, sunrises/sunsets. Astrophotography may also be possible as May 4th is the date for the new moon. Best times for these dates 7th May - 9th are from 11 pm till around 2 am.

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:15 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

While working in the fast-paced High-Tech world, he found relaxation in nature and wildlife photography. Over the years he honed his skills and in the early 2000’s took the step to become a part time professional. Since his retirement from the corporate world he and his wife Nadine have “focused” on nature, wildlife and travel photography, mostly teaching in the classroom and holding workshops in the field. Bob has been teaching and lecturing at many Colorado venues including the Rocky Mountain Conservancy, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Highlands Ranch Community Association, Arapahoe Library District, Douglas County Library District, High Plains Library District, Gardens at Spring Creek in Fort Collins and numerous local camera clubs. He has written four eBooks: Macro Photography - Bringing the Small World to Life, Travel Photography for Fun and Profit(?), Depth of field: A Photographers Guide to Understanding Focus and Digital Nature Photography - Nature and Wildlife for the Outdoor Photographer. His stock file includes images ranging from Alaska to Australia, South America to Europe and Asia. He has extensive experience in the western U.S., especially Colorado and California. Published images and articles have appeared in magazines and newsletters including Falcon, Outdoor World, and several photo newsletters. He was an assistant editor and featured writer/photographer for First Light Monthly Newsletter for Nature Photographers. He is also president of the Colorado Urban Wildlife Photo Club.</p> <p>Please join us and learn all about ""Photographing Colorado’s Mountain Towns""!</p> <p>Colorado’s mountains are full of historic mining towns. Some are vibrant tourist spots, others quiet vacation spots and still others have faded away leaving, at best, a few dilapidated structures. They are all full of photo opportunities. This presentation takes the audience to over a dozen towns and explores their history, current status, a glimpse into their future and of course, opportunities for great photographs. We also discuss the ins and outs of travel to these towns and provide some recommended camera gear for the journey.</p>",

The videos have been screened for accuracy and complete lack of misinformation. So many videos on YouTube are misleading, contain misinformation and are just plain wrong that we felt it necessary to links to videos that meet our educational standards.</p> <p>Link to video;</p> <p><a href=""https://youtu.be/HJYaQJa6Qck"" class=""embedded"">https://youtu.be/HJYaQJa6Qck</a></p> <p>""Every famous photograph was made with a camera less advanced than the one you are using now."" This paraphrased quote is the inspiration behind The Art of Photography’s latest YouTube video titled ""Your camera is better than Ansel’s."" In the ten-minute video, Ted Forbes breaks down his thoughts on the idea that, instead of taking an introspective approach to our photography work, we tend to blame the gear and use that as an excuse to our shortcomings as artists.</p> <p>How often do you hear the phrase ""I don’t have the right lens to get the shallow depth of field I want"" or ""I don’t have this camera body that shoots 15 frames per second."" These laments aren’t uncommon among photographers, but according to Forbes, they miss the point.</p> <p>Sure, it’s fun to gawk over the latest and greatest gear, but it’s by no means necessary in order to create fantastic artwork — this morning's Behind the Scenes article by Michael Benanav should more than prove that point. As Forbes elaborates throughout the video, gear is little more than a tool to create the artwork we’ve envisioned in our head — a means to an end.</p>",

PayReel will cover these issues and more.</p> <p>PayReel: PayReel’s compliance management services take the stress out of hiring freelance employees by meeting all Employer obligations at all jurisdictional levels. Risk mitigation is best managed by smart safety programs and insurance measures. PayReel’s robust insurance policies conform to meet small business needs to large corporate and financial institution requirements and guarantee the highest level of protection for clients.</p> <p>Workers’ Compensation<br/>EPL<br/>General Liability<br/>Professional Liability<br/>Cyber and drone Insurance<br/>Auto, foreign and more</p> <p>WORKER CLASSIFICATION BEST PRACTICES: Accurate worker classification, in our world, is a must. With the rapid growth of the independent workforce, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in scrutiny by the IRS and state labor agencies to ensure workers are appropriately classified. Misclassifying workers as independent contractors presents a huge risk for any enterprise. PayReel will help ensure that all your freelance contractors are properly classified by vetting the work, the worker’s role, evaluating the risk and making a classification decision.<br/>The IRS has very strict guidelines that define true business-to-business relationships and payroll compliance. These guidelines are meant to prevent firms from misclassifying would-be employees and thereby avoid, either knowingly or unknowingly, a bounty of state and federal taxes.</p> <p>Key things to require when working with an IC</p> <p>Your contractor has an established business entity, with a business name and EIN to which invoice payment is made<br/>Your contractor provides services to other businesses outside your firm<br/>Your IC provides certificates of insurance, including at the least, coverage for general liability insurance and workers’ comp insurance<br/>You have a signed per project Agreement for Services between your company and the contractor<br/>In the context of hiring independent contractors and contingent workforce regulations, PayReel pays close attention to all employer obligations at the federal, state and local levels, including wage &amp; hour rules, per diem, ACA tracking, and sick leave mandates.</p> <p>NON MEMBERS $10<br/>MEMBERS FREE<br/>Pizza for everyone.<br/>One beer for ASMP members.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;PLEASE BE SURE TO REGISTER HERE FOR THIS EVENT.

They have a lot of different themes running through the next few months from Sci-fi to Latin American to Nordic films, amongst many other great films and other non-film events too. Prices are much lower than commercial cinemas.</p> <p>Nordic Film Nights travels to Denmark this month, screening “The Guilty”. It has excellent reviews on Rotton Tomatoes and sounds very intense (see the description below).</p> <p>Confined to the police station, Asger is forced to use others as his eyes and ears as the severity of the crime slowly becomes more clear.

Parking is only $2 and exact change is appreciated.</p> <p>This 37 acre garden has something all year round: succulent gardens, bamboo gardens with a lily pond, waterfalls, fruit orchards, CA native plants and more. The lily pond usually has 'critters' sunning themselves in the morning. A route will be suggested when we gather at the Visitor Center for a group photo.</p> <p>Important Notice! The policy of San Diego Botanical Garden is that you need to show ID that you are a resident of San Diego County in order to get in for free (or show your membership card). If you are not a county resident, you have to pay admission (Adults-$18; Seniors-$12).</p> <p>New members in particular will love the opportunity to discover their macro shooting talents. If you have a macro lens, bring it. Another good choice is a fast telephoto lens like the[masked] f/2.8; you can get nice blurred backgrounds with the aperture wide open and you also have the reach to get the eye of the frogs &amp; turtles. You may wish to bring an off camera flash for lighting effects in shady spots. Monopods and tripods are allowed in the Garden.</p> <p>We will meet in front of the Plant &amp; Gift Shop (Visitor Center) to take the group photo promptly at 9:15 a.m. The gates officially open at 9 a.m. although you can usually get in line earlier.

Appropriate camera settings are suggested for each light source and assistance is provided as required.</p> <p>Unlike some other casual photography walks, the photographs taken are set exercises in using light and as such, there is limited scope for individual creativity. My intention is to force photographers out of their comfort zones and use unusual lights in ways they probably hadn't considered. I'm a firm believer that a little knowledge can be a much more powerful tool than fancy equipment. The concepts covered here are a good starting point for talking about lighting in general.</p> <p>This walk is best suited to photographers who are already comfortable with their camera controls and have a working knowledge of the concepts of aperture, shutter speed, film speed (ISO) and white balance.</p> <p>The recommended equipment for the walk is a camera capable of at least ISO 3200, an appropriate portrait lens (eg. at least 50mm or longer) with a reasonably wide aperture (eg. f/2.8 or wider). If you own a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens, it's ideal. Tripods should be left at home as they are usually impractical on this walk. You will not require a flash or any other lighting equipment.</p> <p>As this activity is run outdoors after dark, please ensure you're dressed in appropriately warm clothes and if the forecast suggests rain, please bring an umbrella.</p> <p>We meet at sunset at Federation Square (<a href=""http://www.fedsquare.com"" class=""linkified"">http://www.fedsquare.com</a>) and return to finish at the same location 2.5 hours later.</p> <p>Scroll down to see feedback from previous participants for this activity.</p> <p>If you are having difficulties making payment via Meetup, you can go direct to Paypal (<a href=""https://www.paypal.com.au"" class=""linkified"">https://www.paypal.com.au</a>) and make payment to ""[masked]"".

The best part was, it was loads of fun! Time and money well spent!"" - Beena, May 2016</p> <p>""The evening was extremely informative, David has a wealth of knowledge that he does not mind sharing with everyone. David takes the time to explain camera settings for people like myself that are fairly green in the hobby. My understanding of portrait photography at night has been turned around 180 degrees after attending this session with David, highly recommend attending."" - John</p> <p>""Learnt a lot, with a few key messages that I can add to my photography. Also appreciate some of the tips with camera set up... Lots of fun and even though we both had the two ugliest models to work with (namely ourselves) still got some good shots. For anybody else reading, this meet up is excellent - jump on board."" - Warwick</p> <p>""Cannot look at light the same again! :)"" - Chris</p> <p>""Money well spent. A bargain for the amount of stuff I learnt. I'm seeing more potential in the light around me."" - Sharon</p> <p>""It was absolutely mind-blowing! I have never thought about looking at objects like that and thought that I would need flash in order to take night photography. I have learnt to observe my subject and find the best angle to shoot in terms of light."" - Maggie</p> <p>""Fabulous, very informative and I will now look at taking photos with available light in a very different way. David explained each different light situation very well and I didn't come away feeling 'overloaded'."" - Sandy</p> <p>""So far the best meet up i have been, lots of learning and the group is small that makes the class more personalized."" - Claudia</p> <p>""Excellent. Very informative session to get you thinking of the best ways to use available light."" - Maria</p> <p>""Awesome!! Totally gets your brain buzzing about light and lighting."" - Deanne</p> <p>""Great learning experience with well thought out practical photographic tasks under different outdoor lighting situations with minimum equipment. Learnt heaps on how to assess existing night lighting options and how to use them optimally and creatively. Don't hesitate to join David on his inspiring photographic journeys! :)"" - Jennifer</p> <p>""The evening was very interesting! Definitely opened up my eyes to alternative lighting and how to work with what is available at the time. Great night."" - Samira</p> <p>""Thanks David for a hugely instructive session!!"" - Ross</p> <p>""Thank you David for a very informative and fascinating portraits session with available light. I'm so inspired and excited with experimenting further with minimal available light sources. I look forward to your future sessions."" - Dorothy</p>",

It appears in many places and in many different forms as a gentle reminder of our place in the cosmos. Just as in meditation, tai-chi, and other spiritual and health practices it is up to us to approach the Mandala in hopes that we too can unlock its power. Hong Kong Sacred Spaces is delighted to present an immersive interactive drawing workshop with art instructor Reshma Rohra who will teach us how to draw the Mandala in a deep and meaningful way. Using ink and paper we will explore the meditative qualities of drawing in a mindful and directed way. In this Workshop, you will learn the step-by-step drawing technique of drawing the Mandala to practice mindfulness by setting all your focus on creating a piece of art. No drawing experience needed just a positive outlook and a willingness to learn. All art materials will be provided at the venue.<br/>Workshop Focus:</p> <p>Understanding of Mandalas:<br/>-Learn the Step-by-step Technique for drawing symmetrical Mandalas<br/>-Every Participant's Mandala will be Different from the Other<br/>-Learning about Various Zentangle Patterns and How to Use Them<br/>-Exploring one's Creative Potential with Different Patterns and Colors<br/>-2 Hours of Art Therapy<br/>-Focus on Goal Fulfillment while Drawing<br/>-Understanding the Concept of Mindfulness and Practicing it while<br/>Drawing</p> <p>Workshop takeaway:<br/>-A sense of satisfaction in learning a new form of art<br/>-Benefits of the goal-fulfillment therapy<br/>-The skill to practice Mandalas making after one workshop<br/>-A beautiful piece of art which can be framed</p> <p>Rehma has been kind enough to offer Hong Kong Sacred Spaces Meetup Members a 10% discount.

Currently based in Hong Kong Reshma was born and brought up in India where her interest in Art and Art Therapy began in 2013. Originally thought of as merely an artistic challenge, drawing intricate Mandalas and Zentangle patterns soon became a passion that Reshma has learned to share with those around her. Stroke by stroke, each drawing moving her closer to peace, happiness and a profound sense of fulfillment. This is what she wishes to share with you along with the confidence and awareness of the power of drawing this most beautiful and important symbol.</p>",

There is parking behind the building, even though most of the spots are marked reserved you can park in any of them except the first two on the right. There is an entrance in the back, come in and down the stairs. If the lot happens to be full, drive back down the hill and park across Lamington Road near the bank. Please don’t park in front of the restaurants. You can then come in the front street level entrance. If you don’t like a few stairs, the front entrance is easier.</p> <p>Bring five photos on a flash drive, we'll project them onto a large screen and talk about what works and what doesn't. Professional photographers Loren Fisher and Nat Clymer will lead the discussion but we want everyone to participate. If we get too many people we may skip over a few images so the night doesn't get too late.</p> <p>We learn by getting feedback and this is a great place to feel safe and show your work, bring your best or bring something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. We are very informal and it doesn't matter what your skill level is, we have beginners and advanced and everyone learns something! Even if you don't show photos you will get something by attending.</p> <p>Photos should be jpeg format, at least 1920 pixels wide and preferably 72dpi.</p> <p>Since the Adult Day Center has expenses in hosting us and they have a bigger mission than letting people look at photos, we are paying them each month for the space. So there is a mandatory $10 fee for the critique night payable at the event. Premium Members attend free.

This meet up will be done on a monthly basis &amp; 1 picture will be chosen as the picture of the month.</p> <p>Start submitting your April pictures now until May 7.</p> <p>Pictures from any of the meetups can also be posted forApril pictures as long as they were taken in the month.</p> <p>***Please tell us where you took the picture***</p> <p>We have adopted National Geographic's Your Shot Rules see below:</p> <p>Your Shot Photo Guidelines</p> <p>We allow and encourage all types of photography. We love to see new photography and watch our users experiment with creative styles and techniques. We are device agnostic, happy to see images from full-frame DSLRs, film cameras, smartphones, and others. Our biggest ask is that the photos stay true to your personal vision and to what you saw. Please avoid heavy-handed processing. We want to see the world through your eyes, not through the excessive use of editing tools. If the photograph is manipulated, please describe your process in the caption. Below are some basic photo guidelines.</p> <p>ETHICS: National Geographic supports ethical photography that accurately represents cultures, ecosystems, and wildlife. We expect that the welfare of people, animals, and their environments take precedence over photography. In other words, don’t harm or manipulate the subject or its environment for the sake of creating an image.</p> <p>CAPTION: We insist on truth in captioning and expect full disclosure in the story behind the photo. The description should be complete and accurate. Not only does this establish trust and lend greater credibility to your photo, but it also increases the engagement of the viewer.</p> <p>BURNING AND DODGING: Brightening or darkening specific areas in an image is allowed but should be kept to a minimum and not done to the point where it is obvious. Your goal in using digital darkroom techniques should only be to adjust the dynamic tonal range and color balance of an image so that it more closely resembles what you saw and communicates the mood of the scene.</p> <p>CROPPING: Cropping is allowed, but composing the image in-camera is always ideal.</p> <p>CLONING: Cloning is not allowed.</p> <p>BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY: Converting your color photos to black and white is acceptable.</p> <p>STITCHED PANORAMAS: These are allowed only if the segments were all made within the same time frame. Don't create panoramas with sections made at significantly different times. Do not change focal length while creating a stitched image. Do not stretch the meaning of panorama to include elements that weren't in the scene as you saw it. If your photo is a stitched image, please indicate so in the caption.</p> <p>COMPOSITE OR HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE (HDR): These shots are allowed only if the combined parts are made at the same time. Don't submit final images where the foreground was shot at noon and the sky at sunset. If your photo is an HDR image, please indicate this in the caption.</p> <p>FILTERS: We allow filters on photographs. We ask that you please include a description of how the style was achieved and which filter or technique was used. Use discretion, however, as overprocessing can often make the photo look cartoonish.</p> <p>WATERMARKS: Your Shot always credits the author of a photo whenever and wherever it appears on the site, along with providing a link to the author's profile. Because of this, there's no need to watermark your photo. A small and subtle watermark is allowed but not encouraged—we want to see your photograph without any distractions.</p> <p>Thanks in advance &amp; happy shooting:):)</p>",

People who require a bit more comfort could always stay in nearby accommodation. I envisage them being organised at least a month in advance to allow those who work to organise time off.<br/>If you think this type of photography trip might interest you then leave a comment or note of interest and we can organise a meeting.

There is no sheet music at A People's Choir, only song lyrics, which we'll provide (along with the music videos).</p> <p>We don't care about your singing ability, just your enthusiasm - and we're pretty flexible in that area as well. Just show up and enjoy yourself! It's free.</p> <p>We'll be up on the second floor DC9 Nightclub. Singing starts around 7:30pm, but come early to enjoy the roof and happy hour. The big, sliding door halfway to the roof should be open around 7:00pm. Bring friends, or come alone. We'll display music videos with lyrics. No singing abilities necessary!</p>",

Whether it’s a rock formation in the Southwest or a single wildflower in the Northeast, his eye captures the natural beauty of nature in a clean and vibrant way. In addition to his passion for the details and geometry that nature provides, Bob’s other passion is studying the artistic details of architecture and the automobile. He has captured those details by just shooting specific areas, never the entire building or vehicle.</p> <p>For more information and images, go to his website: <a href=""https://bobpauldingphoto.com/bob_paulding_profile.php"" class=""linkified"">https://bobpauldingphoto.com/bob_paulding_profile.php</a>.</p>",

Equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries, it was established in 1789 as the nation's first executive department.<br/>The State Department is headquartered in the Harry S Truman Building, a few blocks away from the White House, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Its duties include implementing the foreign policy of the United States, operating the nation's diplomatic missions abroad, negotiating treaties and agreements with foreign entities, and representing the United States at the United Nations.<br/>The State Department is led by the Secretary of State, a member of the Cabinet who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition to administering the Department, the Secretary of State serves as the nation's chief diplomat and representative abroad.</p> <p>Diplomatic Reception Rooms:<br/>The Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the U.S. Department of State constitute forty-two principal rooms and offices where the Secretary of State conducts the business of modern diplomacy. Located on the seventh and eighth floors of the Harry S Truman Building in Washington, D.C., the Diplomatic Reception Rooms contain one of the nation’s foremost museum collections of American fine and decorative arts.</p> <p>__________________________________________________</p> <p>EVENT DETAILS - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!</p> <p>Registration: As this is a limited space event there is a $11.95 per person registration fee to reduce the number of people that RSVP and then “no show,” which prevents others from participating.

There literally is no photography related question that they can't answer.</p> <p>Perhaps the most popular segment of the meetings is the 20 to 30 minutes of each week devoted to watching award winning documentaries on select photographers from the 20th century.  These include films on Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Paul Strand, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Cappa and many others.  Watching these documentaries is not only entertaining, but educational as you see how the masters worked at their art and craft.</p> <p>Another popular segment is our ""Show &amp; Tell"" segment where members bring a few (10 to 50) recent images on a flash drive.  Then we project them on our big screen with our state of the art projector.</p> <p>You're welcome to narrate or just let the images show on the screen.  If you want a few images critiqued, no problem, just say so. Jeff will be happy to offer words of encouragement and helpful suggestions to improve the photograph.</p> <p>If you want to show a few photos, just add them in JPEG format to a USB Flash Drive (sometimes referred to as a Thumb Drive) and give them to Jeff at the start of the meeting.</p> <p>This meeting is extremely popular with the regular members and many don't bother to RSVP.  We regularly have 40 or more members in attendance.  It's OK to come late and leave early if necessary, so don't worry about traffic or being late.</p> <p>Everyone is also invited to lunch following each meeting.  We visit several of most popular Clearwater restaurants on a rotating basis after each weekly meeting. This is a great way to meet other members, learn about FCCP and get involved in the photography community.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>My Recommended Retailers</b></p> <p>Where you buy your gear matters.

Hike and picnic afterward (bring your own food and drink) at Island Ford. Please note this is a 5.2 mile hike with some hill climbing...it is not an Easy or Beginner hike. If you are new to this hike, please read all of the information below regarding the distance, pacing, locations, and policies for this hike. Larry's phone number is[masked]</p> <p>This week's location and restaurant: Island Ford is another Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area park. The route I take is about 5.2 miles with mostly rolling terrain, though there are few climbs. We will do the hike in about 2 hours. Dogs are allowed on this trail if leashed. There is a restroom at the parking lot. There is a $5 parking fee if you do not already have an annual CRNRA parks pass. We will NOT be going to a restaurant afterwards today, those wishing to can bring your lunch and we'll eat outside at the picnic area near the river behind the Visitor Center.</p> <p>Prompt Departure Policy: Out of respect for the majority of people who arrive on time, we will leave promptly at the designated time, allowing 1-2 minutes of ""grace period"". If you arrive late, please text or call me at[masked] and I will let you know where we are on the trail so you can catch up to the group.</p> <p>Are you available to hike at 11AM on Wednesdays? Looking to explore some of the nice hiking locations within an hours drive of Atlanta? Looking for a moderate-paced hike of 4 to 5 miles with friendly welcoming people? Like to optionally go out for lunch afterward? Then this is the hike for you !</p> <p>What: A moderate-pace hike of about 4.5 - 5.0 miles, in about 2 hours. See below for additional detail on planned pace and degree of difficulty.</p> <p>When: Every Wednesday at 11AM. Where: We rotate around to 12-14 locations within 30-45 minutes of Atlanta. See below for a list of our usual venues.</p> <p>Who: We generally have at least 20-25 people on each hike, though we've had as many as 30+. We are a friendly group and do our best to make newcomers feel welcome. Dogs are welcome everywhere we hike except Sawnee Preserve, but are required to be on a leash at all times.</p> <p>Intended Difficulty/Fitness-level: The locations and trails chosen for this hike, as well as the hiking pace, are of moderate difficulty. Each hike will be between 4 and 5 miles, and we will hike that distance in about 2 hours.<br/>We will pause briefly a few times for water breaks or to catch our breath. Most of our hikes have hill climbing involved, so these are NOT Easy or Beginner hikes. So this is a moderate hike all around, of about 2.5mph pace. But this is also not intended to be a hard-core ""workout"" hike - if you prefer to hike very fast (e.g. 3mph or faster pace) our experience is that you will be frustrated with the pacing of this hike.</p> <p>Lunch afterward: While not required or expected, please join us for lunch afterward at a local restaurant.

Game. On.</p> <p>If you don't know, now you know...</p> <p>If you've never played the game of kickball as a kid you must have grown up on Mars. But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And no athletic skill is necessary, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!</p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf"" class=""linkified"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf</a></p> <p>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.</p> <p>The important stuff...</p> <p>• This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up.

If you are new to the group, Welcome ( : This group is for anyone interested in photography, regardless of your skill level or what you choose to photograph with. The people in this group are fantastic, welcoming, and willing to share their knowledge. Each month we having a meeting at the Appleton Public Library where we share ideas, talk about photography, and about the monthly challenges. Below is what we'll be talking about this month.</p> <p>I will be in Idaho so Gary will be my taking my place in leading this meeting. Treat him just as amazingly as you all treat me ( :</p> <p>May's discussion will be: ""An Urban Love Affair.""</p> <p>What would you do photographically if someone hired you and said:</p> <p>""Get me some pictures of your favorite places in your town. I want to create a guide book that will attract tourists. I want to see icons of the community. I want them to be interesting. Provocative. Even a bit controversial. The images can be people, places or things. Most of all, I want them to be different from the status quo. I want them to evoke an emotional response of the viewer such that they will want to come to your town.""</p> <p>Henri Cartier-Bresson was a master of this. Some might call it ""street photography,"" but he called it ""The Decisive Moment."" It is a moment when the subject is composed and framed by connecting the minds eye to the eyes of the heart.</p> <p>We will be discussing these concepts at the May meeting.</p> <p>Challenges: Each month I put forth a photography challenge. The idea being to get you out doing photography and trying new things.<br/>The challenge for May is to create the ""Urban Love Affair"" portfolio. Submit your BEST images (1-3) by posting them to the May Challenge folder. I will bring in some images to get you inspired and excited to create photographs. You will have until the July meeting to photograph this challenge.</p> <p>The last challenge given in March, the Creative Live Challenge: Motion blur, bracketing, sandwich bag portraits, water droplets, holiday light bokeh, or car trails, will viewed at this meeting. Here's the link to view the videos. <a href=""https://www.creativelive.com/class/creative-photography-challenge"" class=""linkified"">https://www.creativelive.com/class/creative-photography-challenge</a> (this video is free if you sign up for creative live) Please make sure to add 1 or 2 images to the March Photography Monthly album so that we can look at the images you made. Besides allowing us to get through everyone's images choosing only 1-2 photographs also challenges you to pick your very best work from a session or outing. Only 1 image will be shown during the meeting.</p> <p>We'll be meeting in Meeting Room A on the lower level of the Appleton Public Library at 6:30pm. When you go in the main entrance to the library take the stairs on your right down to the lower level. I look forward to seeing you and the new work you've created!!</p>",

Being able to print with a great degree of consistency and accuracy saves you time, frustration, and money.</p> <p>The old adage, ""WYSIWYG"" (What You See Is What You Get) readily applies when you are properly color-managed. John Watts will show you the 3 steps to successful Color Management and how to implement these into your Photoshop workflow, in a style that even the most die-hard ""non-techie"" can enjoy and understand</p> <p>2) Editing for Success (1/2 Hour):</p> <p>The second part of this Meetup will focus on the concepts of proper image editing.</p> <p>So, you just got back from a photo shoot, and you've got all these wonderful images - now what? How do you properly edit all of your images, pick the best ones, and then make the most out of them using Photoshop?</p> <p>When it comes to a good final image, it's important to be a tough ""self-editor"" of your images, then knowing what you're aiming for before you can properly use the tools in Photoshop.</p> <p>The cost to attend is $5 for this 90 minute Meetup, payable when you RSVP online.</p> <p>A useful handout will be provided. Please note that in the interest of time, the focus will be on proper Color Management and Editing practices, rather than other mechanics, functions, and tools of Photoshop.</p> <p>This low-cost workshop is designed primarily for those fairly new to Photoshop, but it is also a good ""refresher"" course in the basics for those with a bit more experience. As this presentation is in a “seminar” format (via a digital projector), bringing your laptop is NOT recommended, due to limited space and time. Questions encouraged - I'll provide bottled water - Let's have some fun!</p> <p>RSVP now to assure a seat - We should be finished up by 8:30 PM - See you there!</p> <p>John Watts :-)</p> <p>Watts Digital Imaging (<a href=""http://www.wattsdigital.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.wattsdigital.com/</a>)</p>",

All beginners welcome! Everyone needs to start somewhere, right? :)</p> <p>We can teach you how to say ""What's __ in Japanese or English"" so that you can continue to speak as much in the language you are learning as possible!</p> <p>With this event we will put a stop to your inability to practice the language you are learning simply because the person you're talking to is able to speak your native tongue better than you can in their's! Bring some friends who have been suffering along side you and let's get in some REAL life language practice!!</p> <p>Hope to see you there! XD</p> <p>What to bring:</p> <p>1. For Japanese, a one note contribution of just 1000 yen to assist in organising and keeping this group running :). For native English speakers, we are asking for a contribution at this point of just 500 yen. I'd like to be able to buy our group any resources that we need to make our language exchange experience better through this too, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know :). This group will be help kept running by the caring people who support Andy and I in making Shizuoka prefecture an exciting place to live with lots of active, fun events! Without you we couldn't keep making these events so we really appreciate your support!</p> <p>2. Something to take notes with - a pen/pencil, notebook or bring your smart phone and use its memo application.</p> <p>3. Some money for coffee/tea/food from the coffee shop's awesome selection of drinks :)! This place is one of my most favourite coffee shops in Numazu so I'm sure you'll enjoy it too!</p> <p>このイベントはイマージョンで好きな言語で上達したい方とお友達を作りたい方のために行われています。日本で行われるので、ほとんど英語と日本語で練習しますが、他の言語を交換したい方が大歓迎です。</p> <p>この言語交換イベントは他の言語交換イベントと何が違いますか？</p> <p>英語能力が違っていもお勉強で習ったフレーズなどを実際に練習が出来るために1時時間程ほぼ完全に英語で会話します。そして時間になったら、完全に日本語で同じことをします。</p> <p>始める前にほぼ完全に英語で会話が出来るように大事なフレーズ (例えば 英語で___はなんですがか？)を教えてもらって、当日に学んだフレーズだけで、全部の聞きたいことと言いたい事を言えるようになります！なので、初心者でも大歓迎です！</p> <p>持ってくる物:</p> <p>1. このグループが続けるように1000円を持って頂ければと思います。只、外国の方が少ないので人数を増やすように外国の方は500円で御参加が出来るようになっております。優しいメンバーのお陰でこれからも静岡県でいっぱい楽しいイベントが行われるように皆さんのご協力を仰いでいます♪</p> <p>2. メモが出来る物。ノートやボールペンやスマホ。</p> <p>3. 美味しいコーヒーや紅茶や食べ物を注文するために少しお金を持ってくるといいです。葉山珈琲のコーヒーを特に気に入っているので、是非飲んでみてください。</p>",

Hence do bring a bagpack that you can carry along when climbing the stairs.</p> <p>Did you know?</p> <p>If you’re looking to burn calories, lose weight and strengthen and tone major muscle groups, stair climbing provides astounding results. It is widely regarded as one of the most efficient and effective cardio and strength building workouts today.</p> <p>Cardio/Calorie Benefits</p> <p>Burn more calories climbing stairs. It engages the body’s largest muscle groups to repeatedly lift your body weight up, step after step. Using your largest muscles to carry your own weight uphill is far superior to exercising on a flat treadmill when it comes to work performed and calories burned.</p> <p>Strength and Muscle Toning Benefits</p> <p>The simple act of maintaining balance engages core muscles with every step, building strength and endurance . Tone and sculpt your entire lower body. Stair climbing engages every major muscle in your lower body as many as 120+ times/minute: glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps and calves. High repetitions are famous for building lean muscle and burning fat which results in toned and sculpted muscles. You can achieve high work efforts while moving at very low speeds relative to other workout options, minimizing the toll/stress on the body.</p>",

Please drop by this informal gathering any time between 5 and 7:30 PM. The restaurant serves good authentic Hawaiian food and fun cocktails, and there will be live Hawaiian music for part of our gathering time. If you arrive before 6 PM, you can take advantage of the special Happy Hour pricing, but please come by whenever you are able.</p> <p>This event is *FREE*, but you will need to pay for your own food and/or drinks, which can be ordered off the regular menu. Cash is preferred so that I can settle the group's account as a single bill.</p> <p>We'll get to know each other a bit, share travel stories and future travel dreams, discuss any and all photography topics, and (for those who would like) pass around some favorite travel photos we've made. Feel free to bring a few of your favorite images made anywhere in the world (including right near home) to share with the group. Photos can be shared from a phone/tablet or in print form.</p> <p>I'm also very eager to hear your ideas for what events/activities you'd like to join with fellow members of the Meetup group. Over the next few weeks I'm planning to add quite a few events, including workshops, classes, and photo walks, as well as perhaps a couple of new photography tours in destinations around the world. To make this Meetup group as fun and informative as possible, your input is very important!</p> <p>Please come by this gathering and say hi to some fellow travel photography enthusiasts! I'd appreciate an RSVP (friends and family are welcome, but please list the total number of people planning to attend) so that I can best plan for the space and ensure the best experience. Looking forward to seeing you there.</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Kyle</p>",

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:15 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

The turns on a velodrome are usually ""banked,"" or constructed at an angle, and the banking on some of the shorter tracks can reach such incredible angles that it would seem impossible for anyone to ride a bike on them. However, the centrifugal force generated by the riders' speed usually keeps them firmly glued to the track's surface no matter how steep the banking may be.<br/>If you have never been, this is something you have to see to believe.</p> <p>For a great opportunity to shoot some amazing photographs, come join us at North Glenmore Athletic Park on May 2nd to shoot some action packed bike races. While at the track we will have the opportunity to shoot along the perimeter of the track,as well as capturing some shots within the midfield. Given the size of the track there are no limitations as to where we will be able to shoot.<br/>You will however want to bring your best zoom lenses to avoid long walks!</p> <p>Please meet us at the bleachers of the track at 6:00 p.m to setup the cameras and to discuss best shooting practices.</p> <p>See you then!</p>",

Por un lado, el desarrollo cronológico de la obra de Tanit Plana, que incluye nuevas lecturas de las primeras series, como ""Violència aplicada"" [masked]).

We'll break up into shooting teams, and practice the process of directing a shoot and rotating jobs. Everyone will take turns being the shooter, the assistant, and the subject. We are not hiring models, we will be photographing each other.</p> <p>Please review your camera functions and get comfortable shooting in Aperture Priority (or Manual if you like) .</p> <p>• Bring your camera</p> <p>• Try to limit yourself one lens. The goal of the session is practice. I highly recommend just bringing one prime lens if you have one.</p> <p>• Bring a reflector if you have one. Any size and any brand will do. A small 32"" one should cost no more than $10-$20 on eBay or Amazon.</p> <p>• Please do not bring a lot of equipment, and try to avoid storing gear in your car due to the risk of break-ins.</p> <p>If there's a chance of rain, I will cancel the event the day prior.

Larry’s presentation is a day-by-day log of our excursions featuring the diverse animal and plant life as well as glorious sunrise and sunset images. Larry says “it was certainly a trip worthy of having been on my bucket list.""</p> <p>Terri Watson will present on Photographing Action. Whether you want to photograph sports, wildlife, the family pet, or street photography there are three basic principles of action photography: 1) Stopping or freezing the subject in action 2) Slowing the action down only to a point of clarity and intrigue and 3) Panning with the movement of your subject. Terri will cover what to think about to get the effect you want and then translate this thought process to the appropriate camera settings, lens choice, composition, and lighting considerations.</p> <p>About our speakers:<br/>Larry’s a retired Lockheed Martin software engineer who began photography with a Kodak Brownie at an early age thru the late 1960’s. A trip to Alaska helped Larry get back into film photography and to experience digital photography with a 1MB Kodak camera. Larry has traveled to Hawaii, Alaska, the Canadian Rockies, Iceland, and the Galapagos Islands.</p> <p>Terri’s photography focus is on shooting domestic animals and wildlife. She has led safaris to Tanzania for 5+ years during the Wildebeest migration so others can experience the Serengeti, a “place like no other on earth.” This December, Terri plans to add optional Gorilla Trekking excursions and having lived in the Middle East, a pass-through Qatar.</p> <p>PHOTO SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT: Flash - Open Category.

You can see it from space. But I'm amazed a lot of people who live in L.A. have never seen it from Earth, up close. Here's your chance. We'll be staying one mile from the South Rim.</p> <p>PRIVATE LOCATION: Usually at the Grand Canyon, you're in a bland hotel or a crowded campground. But we have this property all to ourselves. But we have our own private area. Our own little world. And yet we're only 1 mile from the Canyon and our location allows us to explore the whole area. Horseshoe Bend. Antelope Canyon.</p> <p>We'll use our location as a base to explore the whole area. We'll spend some quality time at the Grand Canyon. There will be hikes. (We will NOT be doing the Rim to Rim hike. It's not that kind of trip.) We'll watch the Sunset on the Grand Canyon. Hell, we're so close I'm thinking it might also be cool to get up early one morning and watch the sun RISE over the Canyon too.</p> <p>Nearby is a small lake that's supposed to be a great place for evening<br/>wildlife viewing; deer, antelope and javelina (wild desert pigs) come to take a drink.</p> <p>We will also be doing some road trippin' in the area. HORSESHOE BEND. MAYBE Antelope Canyon. Details to come. But I wanted to give you as much advance notice as possible, so I'm posting this now.</p> <p>I'm really looking forward to this.</p> <p>.: READ RSVP INSTRUCTIONS BELOW :.<br/>Most attendees on past trips are in the 25-40 age range.</p> <p>COST for 3 nights: Camping: $110 per person</p> <p>Two large tents are available for use, or you can bring your own tent. Cups, plates and utensils will be supplied. Cooking gear, including pots, skillets, 3 stoves, etc are also available for you to use. You supply your own food (mostly) but I will cook up dinner one night and one morning I'll make my famous blueberry pancakes.</p> <p>CAMPFIRE TIME: HANGING OUT<br/>When night falls, we'll eat and drink, and hang around the fire ring. Maybe play some games, tell stories, get to know each other. For some, this is their favorite part of the trip.</p> <p>GETTING THERE<br/>Leave on Thur or early Fri morning.<br/>Carpooling is required - you coordinate thru a carpool tool I link to. You split gas cost and the $30 park entrance fees (though a lot of people have the Parks Pass, which makes the entrance free.)</p> <p>RSVP INSTRUCTIONS:<br/>I want to make sure you're prepared will be ready to go. So once you RSVP I'll email you a short survey/questions which you need to return to me (So don't forget to give me your email address when you RSVP.) And you won't officially be on the trip until you're confirmed and pay. There will be people going from different Meetup groups so the RSVP's you see here show you an incomplete picture.</p>",

Meeting locations change, so email [masked].</p> <p>How much local music do you hear on the San Diego airwaves?<br/>Corporate radio would have you believe that we live in a local music desert!</p> <p>The truth is that San Diego has a vibrant community of local musicians and artists, but commercial radio has all but ignored local talent. Not surprising because many San Diego stations are programmed out of corporate headquarters with the same playlist as doled out in Idaho and Maine. Shame on them!</p> <p>KNSJ 89.1 FM intends to revolutionize the airwaves. KNSJ is community radio and wants to change the cultural landscape with alternative programming while supporting local artists and their listeners. KNSJ pledges to play more local bands and artists than all the rest of San Diego's radio stations combined.</p> <p>KNSJ intends to focus on creative and socially conscious music. John Legend, in accepting the Oscar for best song, reminded us that ""it's an artist’s duty to reflect the times we're in,""... "" the struggle for justice is right now."" KNSJ wants to create a cultural revolution of hope, of optimism, of love and ire... inspiring collective action to save the planet. While some music is created as escapism, other music becomes anthems for consciousness and change.</p> <p>KNSJ’s Local Music Summits bring together local DJs, music producers, musicians and show hosts to talk about transforming the airwaves with new local radio shows and podcasts. KNSJ’s current local shows include Sonic Sundowner with Benjamin Cossel and Train of Thought Podcast with Gill Sotu. The expectation is that the Local Music Summits will spawn a dozen other music shows from hip-hop to folk, reggae to Blues, Latin, Asian, African and Worldbeat. Many of these programs will feature interviews and insights into the musicians and their creative process as they minister through their music. The expectation is that more local music on the air will result in a growing appreciation of local cultural treasures and in time will result in larger audiences allowing for more musicians being able to sustain themselves through their craft. KNSJ looks towards the day when it becomes a clearing house for local music. KNSJ expects to host live music on the air, and co-sponsor concerts and festivals where there is a convergence of many of the performing arts including spoken word and dance. These music events will in turn support the community radio station, which depends on individual donations for its future growth.</p> <p>Local musicians wanting to get their talent on the air can post their music on KNSJ at <a href=""http://knsj.org/music/"" class=""linkified"">http://knsj.org/music/</a></p> <p>Listen Up: No matter where you are you can listen to KNSJ.org or use the TuneIn radio app or find us on iTunes.</p> <p>For more information contact: [masked] or call[masked].</p>",

How we manage conflict can make or break our day. This class is for anyone who would like to learn how to practice becoming a radiator of peace in moments of conflict. When we feel peaceful and calm within, we open the doors for better communication and feelings of well-being to emerge, not only for ourselves but for all parties involved.</p> <p>In this workshop you will learn:</p> <p>* How to connect to your “objective observer,” the one who notices without reacting.</p> <p>* The Five Common Styles of “Doing Conflict” and how to meet each one with a peaceful response</p> <p>* How to Move From Conflict to Communication</p> <p>About our Guest Speaker: Erin Ramos is a teacher and energy healing practitioner who has spent the past 16 years studying the art of purposeful conflict through the study of energy dynamics and Non-Violent Communication. Erin has had lots of practice managing conflict, up close and personal, with her own family of four.

Every photographer gets individual shoot time of around 10-15 minutes on each of the 2 sets. This may vary slightly depending on the specifics of each shoot.</p> <p>These are peer guided, photo club style shoots, we have and encourage photographers of ALL experience levels attend. A studio photographer attends every shoot to assist new photographers and guide the smooth running of the shoot. Many shoots have a stylist, HMUA or even a collaborating brand.</p> <p>We ask photographers to tag the studio, club, models and any stylist when posting photos from the shoots. This generates some great networking and collaboration between everyone involved.</p> <p>Our shoots are great experience and portfolio builders in a relaxed friendly and supportive environment. Many photographers attend several sessions each month.</p> <p>Goto Facebook.com/groups/JunglePhotoClub on Facebook for the themes list and bookings and to share your photos with the club members and models.</p>",

This can lead to a pretty photograph as we try and show the subject in the best light. However, it is possible to make your image more meaningful with personal interpretation. In this presentation, Nikhil will discuss how you can identify your inspiration and create images that communicate that personal connection, through interpretation.</p> <p>Nikhil Bahl is a full time professional photographer, author, educator and and environmentalist residing in the Washington D.C. area. Drawing continuous inspiration from nature, Nikhil adopts novel approaches and seeks meaningful interpretations: to create photographs that transcend the commonplace, reflect deeper insights, and convey an enchantment of the subject’s beauty.</p> <p>An offshoot of Nikhil's fine art photography and love of nature is his documentation of wildlife behaviors and habitats. As a volunteer with the National Park Service and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, his goal is to portray environmental stories with an artistic appeal, so his photographs educate and motivate about the imperative of conservation.</p> <p>Each year Nikhil leads numerous photography tours and instructional workshops in the United States and abroad. His teaching encourages participants to advance beyond ordinary photos and develop their own style and vision. Nikhil is a popular speaker at photography clubs, expos and industry events. He authored the acclaimed ebook, Creative Interpretations and writes articles on the creative and technical aspects of photography. His work can be viewed at www.nikhilbahl.com.</p>",

He has been enjoying the scenery through the lens.</p> <p>Ron maintains his website as a way to document his travel photography as well as his photo whims and fancies.

Wynn considers wings as a symbol of freedom, truth and justice. The only species that are free to cross the Southern border today are those with wings. Inspired by wing span murals, painted by urban street artists, Wynn considered it ideal to create an interactive art show inside a gallery setting. Viewers can participate by standing in front of oversized life-like bird, butterfly and angel wings to have their photo taken to be shared on social media. This interactive show is dedicated to groups such as Border Angels, Charter for Compassion and Roving Medical Unit. These volunteers assist migrants by trekking water stations into the deserts along migrant paths, administer medical attention, offer legal assistance and temporary shelters. These groups also work to dispel myths that surrounding immigration in the US and that all people are received with compassion and humanity. Wynn herself migrated to the US several years ago crossing the Canadian border from the North. Now a US citizen, Wynn remembers her first 8 years as an illegal alien and is very sympathetic for all the people caught in todays situation along the Southern US-Mexico Border. 7 Arts Gallery will host Angel Wynn’s show “WINGS” with an artist reception Friday May 10, from 5-7pm. The show runs from May 3 through to May 31, 2019. 7 Arts Gallery is located 1/2 block from the Plaza at 125 Lincoln Avenue, Santa Fe, NM.

We prefer to overcome these challenges to the best of our abilities rather than turn anyone away.</p> <p>We will also not be visiting specific URR hiding places such as attics and cellars as for the most part those were either kept secret or have long since vanished within the city. However, we will be walking to various sites and discussing how the Underground Railroad operated throughout the DC/MD/VA region.

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:15 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

Bei uns hilft jeder jedem. Alle Sprachniveaus und Altersgruppen sind willkommen.</p> <p>Deutsch-Anfänger sind oft eingeschüchtert, wenn andere Teilnehmer deutlich besser sprechen. Um Ihnen mehr Zeit zum Finden der Worte zu geben, haben wir deshalb seit Juli <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Survival-German-for-Beginners-Berlin/"">""Survival German for Beginners""</a> gestartet. Die Sitzungen finden meist vormittags, mehrmals in der Woche statt.</p> <p>2. Wir arbeiten u.a. nach der Methode ""LdL"". ""Lernen durch Lehren"" wurde von Jean-Pol Martin für den Französisch-Sprachunterricht entwickelt. Hierbei tritt der Lerner in den Vordergrund. Alle Teilnehmer sind aktiv und übernehmen je nach Niveau verschiedene Rollen. Der Lehrer tritt in den Hintergrund und fungiert eher als Coach statt als traditioneller Wissensvermittler.

Die 3er und 6er-Karten sind 6 Monate gültig! Wir glauben, das ist ein fairer Preis.</p> <p>Darüber hinaus lebt das Café ""Kauf dich glücklich"" natürlich vom Verkauf der Getränke. Es gibt eine Auswahl von Getränken, köstlichen Waffeln und Speiseeis.

Maybe you are new to Vancouver, or maybe you have been here for years and all of your friends moved away or got married and now you are stuck watching Netflix instead of living your life! Whatever the reason fo the situation, it's gotta change. Vancouver is such a great town but it can be socially awkward here... This event is all about helping you get more social and put yourself out there in a way that makes people excited to see you again.</p> <p>It's spring! We are going to discuss how to start the social season strong, as people start to shake off the winter blues and feel friendlier. There are a few simple shifts your need to make and you could be connecting with all sorts of people everyday EFFORTLESSLY! The fact is, humans are social creatures and we need to feel connected to a larger group. But social networking doesn't do the job... we need real world relationships to feel fulfilled in a deep way.</p> <p>At this workshop you will not only learn some really cool stuff around evolutionary psychology and how to use it to finally have the kind of friendships and more that you have always wanted but also you will meet like minded people who are also on this wavelength, the kind of people who are sick of sitting around watching time pass, the kind of people who want to build a tribe!</p> <p>These events are some of the most highly rated events in the city, you don't want to miss this one!</p>",

Gemeinsam mit seiner Studiopartnerin Jessica Walsh liefert er mit dem neuen Ausstellungsprojekt Beauty ein ganz persönliches, visuell beeindruckendes Plädoyer für die Lust am Schönen.</p> <p>Mit spektakulären interaktiven Installationen nimmt das renommierte Designduo Sagmeister &amp; Walsh die Besucherinnen und Besucher mit auf eine sinnlich-vergnügliche Suche: Was ist Schönheit und warum fühlen wir uns von ihr angezogen?</p> <p>Anhand von zahlreichen Beispielen aus Produktdesign, Stadtplanung, Architektur und Grafikdesign möchte das Designduo demonstrieren, dass Schönes tatsächlich besser funktioniert. Unterstützt von Erkenntnissen aus der psychologischen Ästhetik, aus Geschichte, Philosophie und den Naturwissenschaften vertreten Sagmeister &amp; Walsh den Standpunkt, dass Schönheit mehr ist als eine rein oberflächliche Strategie: Sie beeinflusst unseren Alltag, stimuliert unsere Wahrnehmung und macht die Welt zu einem besseren Ort.<br/>Sagmeister &amp; Walsh: Beauty ist eine Kooperation des Museum Angewandte Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, und des MAK Wien. Die Ausstellung wurde in Wien von Kathrin Pokirny-Nagel kuratiert und wird im Museum Angewandte Kunst von Peter Zizka koordiniert.</p> <p>Die Ausstellung wird gefördert von der Dr. Marschner Stiftung. Premium Partner ist Swarovski. Assoziierter Partner ist Jaguar. Sponsoren sind die Unternehmen wienholding und Merz Pharma.

His Leica M4 snapped spontaneous images of everyday people, from the Mad Men era of New York to the early years of the Women's Movement to post-Golden Age Hollywood, all while observing themes of cultural upheaval, political disillusionment, intimacy and alienation. Once derided by the critics, Winogrand's ""snapshot aesthetic"" is now the universal language of contemporary image making. Garry Winogrand: All Things are Photographable is the first cinematic treatment of Winogrand's work, including selections from the thousands of rolls of film still undeveloped upon his unexpected death in 1984. Interviews with Tod Papageorge, Matthew Weiner and more attest to Winogrand's indisputable influence, both as artist and chronicler of culture, while archived conversations with Jay Maisel highlight the gruff, streetwise perspective of ""a city hick from the Bronx."" In the tradition of Robert Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson, Winogrand's candid, psychological style transports us to a bygone world, one where image lacked the editing and control possible today.</p>",

She will cover the effects of trauma, living from passion, truth, self-inquiry, self-love and above all, Gratitude. Bring an open mind and plan to engage, as we’ll ask ourselves and each other questions, we’ll cover both challenging topics and joyful ones, all in the interest of choosing our lives and diving deep into living from a place of appreciation and abundance.</p> <p>About our Guest Speaker: KYLE HOLLINGSWORTH</p> <p>Kyle is a creative polymath, often working on many projects at once. A mother &amp; life partner, artist, designer, writer, speaker, teacher, singer/songwriter, intuitive medium, and sound healer, she lives to create and to be in service of others. She is a powerful stand for self-growth, for truth, and a passionate instigator of full self-expression.</p> <p>Kyle made her way from her home in Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles 25 years ago, never knowing this would be her place of rebirth. After living through decades of trauma and abuse, she reached a breaking point in 2009 where she had to choose whether to continue down a self-destructive path, or grab the reins and redirect herself to a more powerful way of living. She has spent the past ten years leaning into self-awareness, somatic therapy, spiritual practice, and facing the tough truths about the story she’d been living.</p> <p>Now, her passion is to share her experience and the wisdom she has gained through tools and lessons we can all use to live a new story. For her, it starts with gratitude. She has currently written over 1320 consecutive days of gratitude posts - a daily practice that has created a huge shift in her life. She is completing her memoir this year, and hopes to have it published by 2020. She is committed to sharing her story and inspiring others to embrace their birthright to live fully and fearlessly.</p> <p>www.kyle-creative.com</p> <p>Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kylecreative/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/kylecreative/</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KyleCreativeArt/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.facebook.com/KyleCreativeArt/</a></p> <p>Blog: <a href=""https://medium.com/@kylehollingsworth"" class=""linkified"">https://medium.com/@kylehollingsworth</a></p> <p>Songwriter / Vocalist / Sound Healer, Myuna Music<br/>www.myunamusic.com</p> <p>Suggested donation is: $10</p>",

May 11th-12th in Shenandoah National Park is Wildflower weekend. Big Meadows is a fantastic place to roam around and see wildlife and flora that comes out in Spring time. Sun rise is around 6:05 am this morning and the light is great early in the day and there is more opportunity to catch deer grazing. We will meet at the small lot that is located next to the meadows, there is more parking across Skyline Drive at the Wayside store and restaurant. Afterwards for those that would like to go we can drive down to Dark Hollow Falls trail that starts .5 mile from Big Meadows parking. I would recommend a tripod for the meadows and waterfalls but a telephoto lens or macro might be great for the meadows as well.</p> <p>There is an entry fee to the National Park; $30 for a 7 day pass, $50 for a year pass. Fee covers everyone in the car so if you are coming up that day car pooling would help cover the cost same with gas.<br/>It is about a 2 hour drive from Richmond to the location.</p> <p>There is a campground (Opens at March 29th) at Big Meadows and can reserve sties at www.recreation.gov. There is also a lodge (Opens May 8th) that you can stay at if you wanted. Booking for that is at www.goshenandoah.com/lodging</p> <p>There are other campgrounds in the Shenandoah National Park as well as accommodations in Elkton and Luray. You can always back country camp with a free permit in the park but you have to hike in.</p> <p>Lots of information can be found on the main website, www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm</p> <p>If you have any questions about this or have interest in spending more time up there planning a trip, I can help with that as well with trails and other places in the area that we could go to after Dark Hollow Falls.</p> <p>Notes: Big Meadows is a large meadows right off Skyline Drive in Shenandoah Nation Park. Some of the trails that weave through the meadows are wet to as much as 4 inches of water. I recommend comfortable shoes but ones that you don't mind getting wet. There are some great shots from the wet areas. If you are planning on doing Dark Hollow falls after it is a 1.4 mile round trip to the falls going down the mountain and then back up. Don't over exert yourself as it is a 440 ft elevation gain and can be steep in spots.</p>",

Nestled in the heart of Bommer Canyon is part of the old Irvine Ranch Cattle Camp. Some of the original structures exist today, adding to the rustic feel of the Canyon.

No matter how you focus correctly, or expose correctly, if the image is uninteresting, it will be boring to the viewer. The old saying “Garbage in equals Garbage out” is the order of the day when it comes to proper, or pleasing compositions. All the expensive equipment you want to carry around can not fix a boring composition.</p> <p>We must have at least 25 RSVP's or we will not be able to have this event. Using the projector requires that we have half the restaurant. This is not possible unless we have the minimum number of RSVP's.</p> <p>A food or beverage purchase is not required. Please consider purchasing a beverage. They serve coffee, tea, Coke products and various juices. They are providing table service and will have a large room to cleanup after we leave.</p> <p>The class is a more formal structure (unlike our Tuesday night classes) and Jeff will be using both a Keynote (PowerPoint) Presentation and a White Board to explain the basics of “How to Improve Your Photography with the Ten Commandments of Composition.”</p> <p>The entire class is recorded, with audio, and will be available to download or stream for FREE for those that attend. Students will also be provided with a link to download all the slides used in the Keynote in PDF format. This will simplify note taking for some students.</p> <p>If you do not attend the class or you miss a class, the recordings will be available to purchase or FREE for FCCP Supporter members.</p> <p>What FCCP Members are saying about the class.</p> <p>Jeff explains patiently, in a logical sequence, and with strict clarity.

We will use accents pieces and accessories to style the shoot. This shoot does contain nudity.*</p> <p>Who is our model for the evening? Starla Lost - our model for this workshop is an amazing professional art nude model from Ontario who is amazing at posing and is truly a joy to shoot with. She is personally one of my favourite models to work with and the images created are always awesome.</p> <p>We are keeping this group small to only 6 photographers to give more time per person to shoot and for us to create some serious lighting set ups. We will be shooting in a studio equipped with a overhead pantograph system to allow us some serious speed and articulation/ manipulation of the lights.</p> <p>Who/what is this workshop for? This workshop is suitable for all skill levels of photographer (we will give you the settings and tips) We will be doing 4 set ups throughout the evening and we will spend time discussing the set ups and the light modifiers we are using to shape the light.</p> <p>Time is money, and we want everyone to get the most of their experience! That’s why we hold efficient classes; to allow for short, information packed sessions that maximize the shooting time for each participant. You can buy double shooting time in the workshop if you really want to get more time shooting a specify subject just email me for details if your interested in doubling your time in the workshop.</p> <p>What we off from our workshops to our members</p> <p>• A safe and comfortable, yet professional environment for everyone to gather, network, and of course, to take photos!</p> <p>• An array of light modifiers such as; reflectors, umbrellas, soft-boxes, grids, snoots, and beauty dishes.</p> <p>• Multiple, quick, one-on-one sessions with the model(s) to optimize your chances of getting that “perfect” shot- No turkey shoots!</p> <p>“What should I bring to the session?!”</p> <p>First thing’s first; you need your camera! Any model DSLR camera with a working hot-shoe is perfect! *Fresh batteries!

Website here: <a href=""https://www.watchcityfestival.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.watchcityfestival.com/</a><br/>If the weather is halfway decent, the turnout is usually very high and I guaranty you'll come away with some treasured photographs. Starts at 10:00 and that's when I've set the meetup for but there will be many more people later that morning and afternoon so don't worry about showing up late.</p> <p>GEAR: This is mostly a portrait opportunity so bring a fast lens or two (f/2.8 or faster would be ideal but, as always, bring what ya got and make it work) to get that good subject separation. I also strongly suggest an off camera speed light to tame full sun shadows or emphasize subjects in the shade.</p> <p>PARKING: Public lot about a block away at Central Square Parking between Common &amp; Lexington streets. Also 3 minute walk from commuter rail stop.</p>",

We will be meeting at the Kiln 0.5 on Saturday 11th May from 10am to 4pm.</p> <p>The idea is simple, we meet at the beginning of the day for some quick introductions and goal setting, after that it’s 5 hours of quiet working with no distractions. We’ll take a couple of coffee or lunch breaks along the way. At 3.15 you can go home in the knowledge that you’ve done the most writing you’ve got done all month, OR you can stick around for 45 minutes of discussion about an element of writing, news about local writing opportunities and networking with other writers.</p> <p>Our first session is FREE – which is an excellent opportunity to take advantage of the inspiring setting of The Kiln 0.5 at no cost. In the future we will be charging a small fee towards venue and refreshment costs, but we want to make it affordable and inclusive for everyone, so come to our first meeting where our discussion point will be all about how our co-working group will run, how much future sessions will cost and what we want it to be.</p> <p>What do you need to do for the first session?<br/>* Sign up on Meetup<br/>* Bring something to write with – your weapon of choice, laptop, notebook, pens. If you have a file with your current project saved on it don’t forget that too<br/>* Remember your headphones – we will be working in silence, so if you like to write to music, these will be essential<br/>* Bring a contribution towards the coffee machine (the Kiln are very kindly letting us use theirs) and any lunch/snacks you need – at the moment refreshments aren’t provided, although you never know, there may be some homemade, vegan cake</p>",

How do you import your images? What basic editing should you do? How do you share the results with the world?</p> <p>This class will jump start your image editing pipeline using Adobe Lightroom Classic CC. We will discuss the basics of workflow (something every photographer needs just a little of), and then jump into basic editing in Lightroom Classic CC including white balance, exposure, levels, and curves.</p> <p>Students should bring their laptop and will be provided a set of images so they can “click along” with the instructor. Students are also welcome to work on their own images.</p> <p>Concepts Covered<br/>How to import your images.<br/>Where to store your images.<br/>Basic image editing: white balance, exposure, levels &amp; curve.<br/>Cropping and rotating images.<br/>Dust and spot removal.<br/>Exporting your images to share or print.<br/>Already comfortable with this? Check out our Intermediate Photo Editing: Lightroom class that covers more advanced editing such as local adjustments, detailed color editing, and other advanced features.</p> <p>Audience<br/>This class is perfect for anyone that loves to take photographs from beginner to longtime photographer. Adobe Lightroom is great at helping you organize your digital images so you can find them, share and enjoy them. There are many advantages to Adobe Lightroom over Photoshop. If you want to learn photo software I would suggest starting with Adobe Lightroom.</p> <p>Required Equipment<br/>A computer with Adobe Lightroom Classic CC installed and working.<br/>A note pad and pen to take notes if you would like to or a tablet or computer for taking notes.<br/>You may bring a laptop if you want to follow along with your own images; however, the instructor will not be able to provide computer, OS or application support.</p> <p>Schedule and Format<br/>This is a very hands-on class lasting 3 hours with a break around the halfway point.</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Scott is a photographer based out of Cedar Park, Texas. He has a studio in his home and runs Scott D Photography with his wife, Jennifer. Scott fell in love with photography about 10 years ago while working in Chicago and began the long journey of learning all he could. His favorite subject continues to be the concept of ""urban decay"" and his business focuses on family and children portraiture.</p> <p>Scott loves two things about photography. First, you can never learn it all. Second, the industry is brimming with other professionals willing and enthusiastic about guiding you through your next photographic adventure. Teaching has always been a passion for Scott, and he's thrilled to continue that passion.</p>",

Add in the fact that his hometown is over 75 kilometers away in Zhongshan / 中山, Guangdong makes it all the more intriguing.</p> <p>Also interesting is Dr. Sun's unique relationship with women. His many marriages (sometimes running concurrently!) and other histoire de coeur are legendary. He seems to have been every bit the charismatic revolutionary that we see in all the photographs. What is less well know, however, is his relationship with his own mother especially during his formative years before and after he set off to Hawai'i as a young boy.</p> <p>There is scant biographical information about Lady Yang but I think it is still worthwhile to try and fill in the gaps given the vaulted place the Sun family occupies. It is also important, I think, to remember Lady Yang not just as Dr. Sun's Mother but as an important figure in her own right.</p> <p>This event will be a great way to explore the many layers of Hong Kong history from dynastic to modern. The first leg of the route is considered ""Easy"" by hiking enthusiasts BUT keep in mind it is uphill along Fei Ngo Shan Road - 飛鵞山道. We'll return by walking down a portion of Wilson Trail, Section 4. This part of the Wilson Trail is more advanced with slick rocks and more jungle-like conditions so the right footwear is a must. The benefit will be that we'll walk along a local ""ancient trail"" and past the semi-abandoned village, Wong Keng Tsai 黃麖仔 on our way back to Clearwater Bay Road. Great for photos of both nature and ruin-like structures.</p> <p>Those of you who'd like to avoid the last part of the adventure, no need to worry as I'll organize a group to return by walking down FNS Road.</p>",

FOCUS OF THE SHOOT-The focus for this shoot will be “Contrast Colours” and to continue to expand on discussions about focal point, exposure and composition. We ask that you stay within the bounds of Breenhold Gardens. The event will start and end inside the Gardens. There are many wonderful places in the gardens to feed your imagination: trees showcasing stunning autumn leaves and leaf carpeted undergrowth, hidden gardens, statues and old rock steps. Members may shoot on their own or in groups or may spend time with the coordinators. It is completely up to you. If you are not familiar with the area the coordinators will be more than happy to brief you on some ideas. SHOOT DURATION–10:00am to 1:00pm - This includes a 15 min introduction to the coordinators, each member and the plan for the shoot. MEETING PLACE-The coordinators are meeting outside the entry gate to the gardens at 9:30am to enjoy a cuppa before the event. You are most welcome to join us (please remember to bring your thermos and or your morning tea).

Please note we do not have Credit Card or EFTPOS facilities. Please also note there are no discounts or transfer of fees to another Event. LUNCH AFTER THE EVENT-The are no cafes at Mt Wilson and it is such a beautiful location we thought it would be fun to share a picnic in the gardens. If you would like to join us please bring a picnic lunch and a picnic blanket; they can be left in your car during the event. Please note that coming to the picnic afterwards is not mandatory, it is just a good chance to sit and chat about the shoot and get to know each other. IF IT RAINS–Mountain weather can be unpredictable. If rain is intermittent we will continue, however if it is set in we will cancel the shoot and all members will be sent a message, via MeetUp by 6am on the morning of the event. EQUIPMENT SUGGESTIONS–This is a day time shoot so hand held cameras will cope brilliantly. Camera/s, lenses (wide/prime/zoom), tripod if you wish. Remember to ensure your camera battery is fully charged and that you have a spare. As this is Autumn also bring something to protect your gear from any rain or fog. A NOTE ABOUT GEAR – The coordinators do not provide any photography equipment/gear of any type, at anytime for group or individual member use. Please ensure you bring everything you need. WHAT TO WEAR–Comfortable, warm, waterproof shoes, warm clothing. Sunburn cream is always a wise accessory. Water to ensure you stay hydrated and an umbrella / wet weather clothing as the weather changes rapidly in the mountains. HOW TO GET THERE Car–is the only transport option. 29 The Avenue, Mount Wilson, NSW. DISCLAIMER - By indicating your planned attendance at our Event you understand you will attend at your own risk. Our intent is to take all care in the organisation and execution of the event however we are simply facilitating the opportunity of like-minded women to socialise and enjoy photography, and maybe learn some new skills, while also making new friends. No responsibility will be taken, by the co coordinators, for any loss or damage of any equipment or injury of any kind to your person before, during or after the Event.

What could be better…except a Photo Workshop with popular photo tour leader and Central Park maven Steve Rosenbach!</p> <p>Back by popular demand... several members wanted to come to the last one but couldn't make that date.</p> <p>This is a photo workshop that I carefully designed so as to get the maximum amount of great photo opportunities within about a 3 hour easy walk. I’m limiting the number of people who can attend, so that I can spend time with each of you to help with anything you need in getting really compelling images of the sites that we visit along the way. That can range from basic photo or camera help to assistance with composition and advanced techniques.</p> <p>Also, as an added value, you'll be able to send me your photos (or links to them) from this workshop for evaluation and feedback. I'll make comments and suggestions, and in many cases, do some photo editing on your photos to demonstrate how to make a good image even better.</p> <p>Our first stop will be Strawberry Fields, an intimate haven just inside the park set aside as a memorial to John Lennon. From there, we’ll circumnavigate The Lake to take advantage of panoramic views with the elegant skylines of Central Park West or Fifth Avenue in the background.</p> <p>We’ll “get lost” in The Ramble, a bucolic, forested tract with a picturesque stream and rustic bridges where, for the moment, you can imagine that the city is far away.</p> <p>Finally, we’ll arrive at Bethesda Terrace, an iconic, romantic plaza that you’ll recognize from countless movies. We’ll explore the Terrace from the grand sweep of its monumental staircases to the intricate carvings of honeybees and birds along its steps.</p> <p>All together, we'll see 30 unique and photogenic features in the heart of Central Park, and along the way, Steve will regale you with stories of the Park and the specific sites we'll visit.</p> <p>It will be a journey that will delight your sense of color, texture, and proportion as well as refresh your spirit.</p> <p>**** NOTE!

The exhibition draws its title from the rallying words of transgender artist and activist Marsha P. Johnson, underscoring both the precariousness and the vitality of LGBTQ+ communities.</p> <p>The exhibition presents twenty-two LGBTQ+ artists born after 1969 whose works grapple with the unique conditions of our political time, and question how moments become monuments. Through painting, sculpture, installation, performance, and video, these artists engage interconnected themes of revolt, commemoration, care, and desire</p>",

No standing still on stage for these guys… the legacy of AC/DC demands 110% effort and RIFF/RAFF delivers.</p> <p>RIFF/RAFF’s collective talent allows them to perform songs from the entire AC/DC catalog. Mike Barnes nails the vocal styles of both legendary front-men, Bon Scott and Brian Johnson. The oft-overlooked rhythm section of AC/DC is represented in true RIFF/RAFF style by Michael Spencer (as Cliff Williams), Joel Proto (as Malcolm Young) and Steve Marshall (as Phil Rudd). Together, they form a cohesive unit of sonic thunder that is certain to shake your foundation.</p> <p>When asked to describe AC/DC in one word, most fans would simply reply, “Angus”. Voted the all-time, #1 rock icon by Kerrang! Magazine in 2007, Angus Young is the embodiment of rock and roll. Hitting the stage in Angus’ patented schoolboy outfit and brandishing his signature Gibson SG, David Chapman channels Angus’ spirit into each and every performance, firing off riffs and solos so close to the original that you’ll wonder if you are actually watching Angus’ twin in action.</p> <p>RIFF/RAFF prides themselves on an overall production and performance true to the nature and legacy of the legendary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group, AC/DC.</p> <p>RIFF/RAFF's blistering performances have garnered praise from the fans of Sacramento's classic rock station, ‘96.9, The Eagle’, and endorsements from legendary classic rock radio host Tom Nakashima. Pat Martin, radio host at 98.5 KRXQ (‘98 Rock’), commented that RIFF/RAFF is a ""class act and his favorite tribute band.""</p> <p>Come see why RIFF/RAFF is the premier AC/DC Tribute Band</p> <p>Cover Charge TBD.

What could be better…except a Photo Workshop with popular photo tour leader and Central Park maven Steve Rosenbach!</p> <p>On this photo workshop, we’ll explore the visual delights of the southern portion of the “Lower Park,” that is, between Bethesda Terrace (at W 72nd Street) south to Central Park South.</p> <p>I’ve carefully designed this workshop so as to get the maximum amount of great photo opportunities within about a 3 hour easy walk. I’m limiting the number of people who can attend, so that I can spend time with each of you to help with anything you need in getting really compelling images of the sites that we visit along the way. That can range from basic photo or camera help to assistance with composition and advanced techniques.</p> <p>During this workshop, we’ll cover most of the south end of the Park, There will be good opportunities for street photography along The Mall, with its many vendors and street performers. As we move further along, we’ll encounter continuously varying, photogenic landscapes, thanks to the brilliance of the Park’s designers over over 150 years ago. You’ll be able to put your own creative stamp on the view of Gapstow Bridge with the Midtown skyline in the background, one of the most iconic scenes in the Park. We’ll cover many of the bridges and arches in this stretch of the Park, each with it’s own unique design and character.</p> <p>Also, as an added value, you'll be able to send me your photos (or links to them) from this workshop for evaluation and feedback. I'll make comments and suggestions, and in many cases, do some photo editing on your photos to demonstrate how to make a good image even better.</p> <p>It will be a journey that will delight your sense of color, texture, and proportion as well as refresh your spirit.</p> <p>EARLY BIRD SPECIAL! Register by April 15, 2019, and take advantage of $10 off the regular price!</p> <p>BONUS! All participants will receive a gift card worth $25 towards prints and other photo products at Nations Photo Lab <a href=""https://www.nationsphotolab.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.nationsphotolab.com/</a></p> <p>**** NOTE!

Because this is a figure shoot the models have agreed to pose nude for at least half the shoot, but they if they wish they may wear clothing, swimwear, or a costume for the other half of the shoot.</p> <p>The photographers will be divided into groups . Each group of photographers will photograph one of the models, after 15 minutes the group will shoot the next model, and then switch to the last model after another 15 minutes. Then the process will be repeated.</p> <p>This allows ALL of the photographers to shoot the models twice so that everyone can shoot the models in costume (if they decide to wear one) and out of costume.</p> <p>Several attractive models have expressed interest and availability.</p> <p>One model will be hired for every 4 photographers that register up to a maximum of 12 photographers,</p> <p>------CONTINUED IN COMMENTS SECTION BELOW-----</p>",

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:26 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

Given that, you will need:<br/>- A sturdy tripod<br/>- A remote shutter release, preferably an intervelometer or some other method for timing an exposure longer than thirty seconds. A stopwatch will do in a pinch<br/>- Any lens of your choosing. A fast lens in not needed. I'll be bringing my 24-70mm, 16-35mm, and probably a 21mm prime.<br/>- A red-light flashlight. As our eyes adjust to the low light, you will still need something to see your camera controls (or the ground as you walk.) The red light will allow you and everyone else to keep our night vision.<br/>- Another flashlight (or more)for light painting. Consider how it will affect white balance. LED is good, incandescent can be good, fluorescent is not so good imho.<br/>- If you like, a snoot (in its most simple form, an empty toilet paper or paper towel roll) to tape to your flashlight for 'precision' light painting<br/>- Extra Batteries!!!!<br/>- Of course, creature comforts - water, appropriate clothing, even a chair if you don't mind carrying it.</p>",

The event is mostly staffed by about 200 volunteers, many of whom have been volunteering for many many years. There are lots of fun activities happening for the kids and their families, including celebrities, sand castle building, games, music, arts &amp; crafts, face painting, quilt production, food, fun, and.... and this is where we come in.... FAMILY PORTRAITS!</p> <p>We need your help. We need about 20 photographers to volunteer for this incredible event. Most will be in teams doing professional family portraits, and a few will be doing candid photographs around the event venue. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a beginner, this is a very rewarding event. If you're new to the profession please feel free to volunteer. We'll be grouping less experienced photographers with more experienced, so everyone will be able to participate and learn.</p> <p>Each attending family will be entitled to a free professional family portrait. In many cases, this is the only portrait this family has, or may ever have. It means so much to the families, and you'll feel their love and appreciation all day.</p> <p>In order to participate, you'll need to RSVP. I'll get back to you with questions and to confirm your participation. Do NOT show up unless you've been confirmed, as you will not be admitted.</p> <p>VERY IMPORTANT: Please only volunteer if you are really committed to being there. This is a big event and we need everyone there who says they'll be there.

Circular.</p> <p>The Chess Valley has some of the most attractive countryside in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p> <p>Walk Description</p> <p>The walk starts from Chorleywood Station and then crosses Chorleywood Common, an attractive 76 hectares of grassland and woodland. The mix of grassland, ponds and woodland provides excellent conditions for a wide range of flora and fauna. We then take a route following a loop along the Chess Valley with the mid-point at the village of Latimer. This is a landscape rich in wildlife, with a long and fascinating history. We will pass the site of a Roman farm-villa at Latimer, and the 13th century Chenies Manor visited by Elizabeth I. There will be a short stop at the watercress beds at Sarratt, the only commercial watercress farm left in the Chilterns.</p> <p>History and Trivia</p> <p>A village settlement has been at Chorleywood since Roman times. During the 17th century after the Turnpike act it was able to use its favourable location as a major point on the road between Hatfield and Reading to charge for its road use. Extensions of the Metropolitan Railway to Chorleywood in the 19th Century brought it into the rapidly developing commuter belt of London and further population growth. In the 1960's researchers at Chorleywood improved on established bread making processes (Chorleywood Bread Process), this is now used in 80% of the current UK bread production. The village of Latimer is particularly attractive with a number of 17th and 18th century cottages surrounding a small village green with a green pump.</p> <p>Lunch and Finish</p> <p>Please bring a packed lunch and water for the walk. The walk will finish at about 17.00pm and include a 30 min lunch stop, however the time may be earlier or later than this depending on the weather and pace (we have a relaxed pace which includes sightseeing and photography).</p> <p>Meeting and Transport</p> <p>Meet at the entrance to Chorleywood Railway Station from 11.00am for the walk to start at 11.15am.</p> <p>Car: There is free parking close to the station such as Lower Rd, and the common car park, the station charges on a Sunday. Please check for parking restrictions.</p> <p>Train from London : The 10.42am train from London Marylebone gets to Chorleywood for 11.09am.</p> <p>I would suggest meeting outside the WHSmith shop at London Marylebone from 10.00am to give you time to meet others for any group save tickets (see picture below).</p> <p>Please note the organizer will not be taking the train from London Marylebone but will meet you at Chorleywood.</p> <p>See Chiltern Railways (<a href=""http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/</a>).</p> <p>Chorleywood is also served by the Metropolitan Underground line.</p> <p>See Transport for London (<a href=""http://www.tfl.gov.uk/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/</a>)</p> <p>I would encourage you to seek other members who can take advantage of a group save on the train.</p> <p>Please make a note of the organizers numbers - Leon[masked]</p> <p>RSVP: The organizers monitor non-attendance; please update your RSVP beforehand.

Circular.</p> <p>The Chess Valley has some of the most attractive countryside in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p> <p>Walk Description</p> <p>The walk starts from Chorleywood Station and then crosses Chorleywood Common, an attractive 76 hectares of grassland and woodland. The mix of grassland, ponds and woodland provides excellent conditions for a wide range of flora and fauna. We then take a route following a loop along the Chess Valley with the mid-point at the village of Latimer. This is a landscape rich in wildlife, with a long and fascinating history. We will pass the site of a Roman farm-villa at Latimer, and the 13th century Chenies Manor visited by Elizabeth I. There will be a short stop at the watercress beds at Sarratt, the only commercial watercress farm left in the Chilterns.</p> <p>History and Trivia</p> <p>A village settlement has been at Chorleywood since Roman times. During the 17th century after the Turnpike act it was able to use its favourable location as a major point on the road between Hatfield and Reading to charge for its road use. Extensions of the Metropolitan Railway to Chorleywood in the 19th Century brought it into the rapidly developing commuter belt of London and further population growth. In the 1960's researchers at Chorleywood improved on established bread making processes (Chorleywood Bread Process), this is now used in 80% of the current UK bread production. The village of Latimer is particularly attractive with a number of 17th and 18th century cottages surrounding a small village green with a green pump.</p> <p>Lunch and Finish</p> <p>Please bring a packed lunch and water for the walk. The walk will finish at about 17.00pm and include a 30 min lunch stop, however the time may be earlier or later than this depending on the weather and pace (we have a relaxed pace which includes sightseeing and photography).</p> <p>Meeting and Transport</p> <p>Meet at the entrance to Chorleywood Railway Station from 11.00am for the walk to start at 11.15am.</p> <p>Car: There is free parking close to the station such as Lower Rd, and the common car park, the station charges on a Sunday. Please check for parking restrictions.</p> <p>Train from London : The 10.42am train from London Marylebone gets to Chorleywood for 11.09am.</p> <p>I would suggest meeting outside the WHSmith shop at London Marylebone from 10.00am to give you time to meet others for any group save tickets (see picture below).</p> <p>Please note the organizer will not be taking the train from London Marylebone but will meet you at Chorleywood.</p> <p>See Chiltern Railways (<a href=""http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/</a>).</p> <p>Chorleywood is also served by the Metropolitan Underground line.</p> <p>See Transport for London (<a href=""http://www.tfl.gov.uk/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/</a>)</p> <p>I would encourage you to seek other members who can take advantage of a group save on the train.</p> <p>Please make a note of the organizers numbers - Leon[masked]</p> <p>RSVP: The organizers monitor non-attendance; please update your RSVP beforehand.

He is learning kundalini yoga for the past 14 years under the training of Self Realized Indian Master ""Maha MahaRishi Paranjothiyar"". He is teaching yoga for the past 10 years as part of ""Maha Shakthi Meditation Services, Europe"". He teaches Yoga/Meditation/Pranic Healing/Stress Relief courses in various places of Germany and Switzerland. He is the authorized kundalini yoga wisdom teacher to activate the Kundalini Energy in a traditional way (Shaktipat).</p> <p>All these events are conducted for non-profit purpose. Donations are collected on behalf of a Swiss non-profit organization (Verein) ""Maha Shakthi Yogam - Switzerland""</p> <p>Eligibility:<br/>Anyone can attend the workshop even if they don't have previous yoga experiences.</p> <p>Dress:<br/>Wear a comfortable dress if possible yoga dress.

Limited Seats !<br/>RSVP in meetup does not guarantee the course admission.<br/>Send us a private message in Meetup for registration.<br/>Admission is strictly only for people who have registered with us.</p> <p>About Kundalini Shaktipat:<br/>In every human being there is a source of natural energy that the yogis call the kundalini. In order to evolve in the yogic path, no matter what our path, the kundalini must be active.<br/>For most of us, the kundalini lies dormant at the bottom of the spine in the base chakra known as the Muladhar. When it awakens, it ascends through the chakras until it reaches the highest chakra, the Sahasrar. When that occurs, we merge with our True Self and attain SELF realization (our true nature).</p> <p>Shaktipat is the transfer of spiritual energy from the teacher to the student in order to awaken the kundalini. This process is compared to lighting one candle with another that is already lit and glowing. When the teacher is connected with the fully realized master and the energy is completely within his or her control, shaktipat initiation ensures that the student’s energy will remain active and stable. ""Electricity is present everywhere, but there can be light only when the switch is turned on.

Especially in the early Showa period (1925 -mid 1930s), the district had some department stores lined up and was so called “Ginza of Yamanote,” a top hilside commercial district.</p> <p>*Karyukai: A society or physical district of Geisha Ladies – who have trained manners and skills of traditional music and dancing, and Ryotei - where Geisha Ladies present traditional performances during fine Japanese multi-course dinners.</p> <p>The district was completely destroyed by the air raids in the WW II, but rather quickly restored its prosperity by the 1960s. In recent years, the Karyukai has scaled down, yet we still find the district of Ryotei, where stone-paved alleys &amp; black-board walls are laid out, the sounds of laughter, and shamisen, a traditional music instrument, flowing over.</p> <p>Kagurazaka also hosts many French residents and restaurants which creates an atmosphere somewhat like the back alleys in Paris, adding another charm. Such diversity, and harmony between the old and new, attracts many people!</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE:</p> <p>If you smoke, please do so only in designated smoking areas.</p> <p>Your comments and suggestions for future meetups are always welcome!</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Your event organizer, Kerry D. @}:^)</p>",

Well, here's your chance to do some portrait shots with them. Fashion and portrait photography is my day job and I can show you how it's done.</p> <p>Using one speed light in portrait photography can get you great results but only if you know how to do it. We're here to show you how. It's really easy.</p> <p>We're only taking upper body shots so you won't need anything fancy. You may already have invested in a speed light, soft box and radio trigger. We'll show you how to use all of them and, by the end of the day, you'll be surprised at the results! You'll learn how to position the light, how to pose your subject and in just 5 hours of practice, you'll become quite good at it.</p> <p>And best of all, this tutorial is free! So come to Kowloon Park at 1pm after you have your quick lunch. Or pack your lunch and eat in the park.</p> <p>How to find us:<br/>If you come by MTR, get off at Tsim Sha Tsui and look for Exit A1. After you exit on the ground level you'll be facing Nathan Road (full of people and traffic). As you stand there, next to your right is Haiphong Road. Turn right and walk back on Haiphong Road and look for the Kowloon Park gate entrance. You'll see a wide sloping pathway. All of us will be there waiting. Don't be late. After the shoot, we'll all go for tea and coffee and compare photos.</p> <p>Watch this video of our previous event: <a href=""https://youtu.be/4ar3FOyHsdE"" class=""embedded"">https://youtu.be/4ar3FOyHsdE</a></p> <p>We'll be split into groups of 3 people. One to shoot, one to hold the light and one to model. We'll switch and take turns.<br/>I'll first give a demo to everyone when we meet. After that, I'll go around to each group and check on your camera settings, lights and guide you all on the shots.</p> <p>What to bring:<br/>1. A camera with a flash hot shoe.<br/>2. A radio trigger for triggering your flash. (Godox, Pocket Wizard,<br/>ProPhoto, Yongnuo, Flashpoint, etc)<br/>3. A speed light that works with your camera and trigger. (Canon, Nikon,<br/>etc)<br/>4. A small soft box or light modifier. (A white shoot through umbrella will<br/>do)<br/>5. A light stand. (to mount your flash and light modifier)</p> <p>But if you don't have all these, just bring a camera and a reflector. The reflector will help tremendously in your shots.</p> <p>Note: All of you will take turns being models. So dress nice and put on your makeup. Bring some accessories like sunglasses, hats, etc. Yeah, the men, too! We're only shooting upper body - from waist up.</p> <p>See all of you there, folks! Don't be late!</p>",

Its designed to be fun and not as formal as that sounds ...... for up to six people, the day starts with a challenge, followed by 1:1 mentoring and ending up the day watching (and photographing) the sunset. More details below :)</p> <p>The session is all about looking for, finding and using reflections, sunsets and symmetry in your photography</p> <p>One of the places which is good for sunsets and reflections (not sure I can find an ideal place for all three) is Bosham Harbour. With its large expanse of sheltered and relatively flat water at high tide, its very good for reflections of Bosham Quay, and good too for sunsets as they reflect too …..</p> <p>LOGISTICS</p> <p>We will meet in Bosham Quay car park at 18.30 and walk around the inland harbour to its south side. Opportunities for reflections and symmetries are all around, and at the south side of the harbour we will wait for sunset at 20.45. High water neaps is 19.00. A postcode very near the car park is PO18 8HT. Its easy to find. There are charges but they wont break the bank.</p> <p>Pray for some quiet weather and some high level cloud for the sunset and we could get some very striking images indeed.</p> <p>The walk there and back is around 1.5km in length. Its flat …..</p> <p>If time at the end of the event allows, we will drop into the Blue Anchor for a chat, debrief and a packet of crisps .....</p> <p>HOW WILL WE KNOW IF IT IS GOING AHEAD?</p> <p>Just about the only reason to cancel the event is if there is a reasonable chance of rain. I will get a very good idea two-three days ahead of the event and cancel, if appropriate, at that point. If I cancel I will offer refunds :)</p> <p>If we are going ahead then I will send out an A4 training sheet giving details about the compositional techniques involved. Look out for it!</p> <p>WHO IS THIS FOR?</p> <p>As its about one of the basics of composition its for anyone who wishes to improve their photography. It does not matter at all what camera or mobile camera you have, nor what settings you choose to use.</p> <p>Beginners and improvers benefit, and I’ve begun to realise that many of those who consider themselves experienced can benefit. My photography too has improved since starting the sessions …..</p> <p>ESSENTIALS AND ADMIN DETAILS</p> <p>My phone number in case you get lost (it happens!) is[masked].</p> <p>Bring a torch and wear Wellies. Bring an extra layer of clothing, it can get colder towards sunset</p> <p>Any other questions, fire away in the comments section!</p> <p>Andy :)</p>",

He has crisscrossed the globe with the likes of director and activist Iara Lee, explorer and TV host Richard Wiese, and trouble-and-movie-maker Andrew Wonder as a production sound mixer; he has been supervising sound designer for folks such as indie horror legend Lloyd Kaufman and actor/producer Max Casella; and he has mixed countless commercial spots, animations, documentaries and narrative films for people and companies from fine artist Susan Philipsz to director Musa Syeed to NBC. Driven by a desire to excel in his craft and a belief that he can always learn more, Cory has never been afraid to go off the beaten path: he was an early adopter of both Sonic Foundry Vegas and the groundbreaking DAW REAPER from Cockos, has been a proponent of the game-changing Zaxcom Nomad, and is constantly searching for and thinking about new and better ways to record, edit, create, and mix sound.</p> <p>About Hunt</p> <p>Hunt Beaty is a producer, director, and Emmy award-winning production sound mixer based in Brooklyn, NY. Born and raised in Nashville, TN and NYU Tisch Film Graduate (and he jumps out of airplanes for fun).<br/>Most recently Hunt embarked on a year-long project to make six short films alongside filmmakers Wesley Wingo and Andres Cardona with the intent of reinvigorating their “narrative muscles,” so to speak. The team rotated the director role with each project and released the films online as fast as possible. The shorts earned thousands of views, multiple Vimeo staff picks, and a slot in the 2019 SXSW film festival.</p> <p>Check them all out here: www.sixshortfilms.com</p>",

Meanwhile, far below, the denizens of the dismal workers’ city struggle to survive every day. Unrest between the disillusioned working class and society’s elite reaches its breaking point when Freder, the son of the city’s richest and most powerful man, becomes aware of the inhumane conditions under which the working class must exist. As he falls in love with Maria, who preaches to the workers about a better world in which the “head” and “hands” of the city live side-by-side, Freder is determined to become the “heart” that brings these two groups together. What he is not prepared for is the chaos that this mission will unleash.

Wildlife photography often entails experiencing unpleasant photo shooting conditions such as extreme cold or heat, driving rain or snow, mud, mosquitoes and more.

We’ll be at the hotel so you can drop off your luggage and we’ll help organize an excursion into the city or enjoy the hotel’s beautiful pool. There is a shuttle from the hotel into Rome which makes getting to the main sights easy. Bright and early the next morning we head north to Tuscany stopping in medieval villages, lush countrysides glowing with red poppies, vineyards and a day in Florence.</p> <p>The full itinerary is below and you can see it is packed with tremendous locations with plenty of beautiful towns and countryside to photograph. While we want to see it all, we don’t want to wear anyone out. As photographers, we love the morning light so we will be out shooting at sunrise most days. We will take two to three hour breaks from shooting at mid-day as needed, when the light isn’t as nice to catch a nap or refresh. Each day either Ron or Loren will be available during these mid-day breaks for image review or work with you on your photography. You will have time to explore on your own or stick with the group.</p> <p><img src=""https://lorenphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-334x500.jpg"" /></p> <p>What is included: Eight days lodging for seven nights, each photographer has their own room Workshop adventure 2 pro photographers/guides Photo Walks Breakfast most mornings Small group size Four star hotels Local transportation Professional photography instruction What isn’t included: Travel to Italy Lunches and dinners Alcoholic drinks Gratuities Non-meal time snacks and soft drinks Who should Attend Anyone with an interest in Italy, beautiful landscape and historic towns – your photographic experience doesn’t matter.

Make sure you have lots of memory cards, spare batteries and charger and maybe a polarizer filter. Since we will do some night photography, you’ll want a sturdy tripod. We also suggest bringing a laptop to download your photos and a way to have a backup, either on the original cards or an external hard drive. If you aren’t absolutely sure of everything that your camera does, bring your instruction manual so we can help you fix any problems.</p> <p>Dining Breakfast most days is included. If we are out on a sunrise shoot we might not get back to the hotel while they are still serving, on those days you’ll grab something on the road. You are responsible for other dining expenses. We will be on the move but taking breaks to enjoy the scenery, dining and wine.</p> <p>Itinerary(subject to change) May 15:Arrival in Rome.We will meet at the Golden Tulip Hotel, which is less than 15 minutes from Rome’s Fumicino Airport. Our hotel for the first night is 4-star rated with a fabulous pool, tropical bar and modern rooms. You can relax and unwind to get ready for our great photography experience or spend the day exploring Rome. Our first official get together is 7:00 p.m. for dinner at the poolside restaurant and the best part is dinner in on us!</p> <p>May 16:We depart early to begin our adventure as we head north to Tuscany. We’ll stop in Sovana, a beautiful ancient village built in the 17th century for our first photo shoot. After a fun lunch we drive to the amazing 18th century winery and hotel. The property has a 600-year-old vineyard and the owners will be waiting for us to sample the estate’s wine and olive oil. This will be home for the next few days and photos in the area abound.</p> <p>May 17: After an early breakfast at the hotel we will be off to shoot what is known as the Strada Chianti – the road to all the famous vineyard towns. We’ll visit Ron’s favorite, the medieval Chianti town of Castellina in Chianti and also Panzano, Greve in Chianti and tiny Montefioralle. As darkness settles in we’ll have one of our famous tailgate dinners as we wait for the full moon to rise over an ancient hilltop village.</p> <p>May 18:Today we’re off to Florence. Not only will we photograph the must-see piazzas and other main attractions, we will shoot some of Florence’s lesser known neighborhoods, markets and back streets. After lunch, which will be insanely good if we can get in to the amazing Il Latini, we will shoot from Giotto’s Campanile bell tower down on the Duomo. We make our way back by way of Fiesole which looks out over Florence for the golden hour light.</p> <p><a href=""https://lorenphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Montichiello.pngMay"" class=""linkified"">https://lorenphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Montichiello.pngMay</a> 19:Time to head south to the heart of Tuscany, the Val D‘Orcia region and the famously photogenic rolling hills that surround Pienza and Montepulciano. The fields should be filled with beautiful red poppies. We check in at our new hotel, near the “Centro Storico,” the old town. We’ll visit Montepulciano, which is only five miles away and the S roads of Monticchiello (you know, like in “Under the Tuscan Sun,” with Diane Lane). At night we eat at the “to die for“ Trattoria La Buca delle Fate, one of Ron and Loren’s favorite restaurants in all of Italy.</p> <p>May 20:Today we are up early for the Tuscan sunrise and then we visit some of Pienza’s neighboring little towns like Chiusi and Montalcino. We will take a long mid-day break so you can catch up on sleep or wander over to the marvelous shops in Pienza’s old town. We’ll have an early dinner at the tiny but special Osteria Sette di Vino before going back out to the countryside for golden hour and sunset. One of the special treats of Pienza is Buon Gusto Gelateria, one of the best gelato places in all of Europe. It is a great way to end the day.</p> <p><img src=""https://lorenphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6930-334x500.jpg"" /></p> <p>May 21:We head out while it is still dark so we can get to one of Tuscany’s truly special places, Podere Belvedere. You have probably seen photos from there as the sun comes in sideways from the left backlighting the building and cypress trees on a rolling tuscan landscape that many say is unrivaled. Then we go down the road to Cappella della Madonna di Vitaleta, the famous church of Pienza. The little church sits on a hilltop out in the field and it looks great in the morning golden hour light. We’ll go back to Pienza, grab some breakfast and take a little rest before going to Montepulciano for vineyards galore, lunch, shopping, tastings and shooting the old town before heading back for an afternoon break. As the evening light glows, we go back toward Montichiello watching the sunset and then we photograph the “blue hour” and try some light painting.</p> <p>May 22:Our saddest day, the last one. The hardy will go out and photograph sunrise in the fields below Pienza. After breakfast we head back to Rome to make flight connections.</p> <p>To register and for more information, go to <a href=""https://lorenphotos.com/mevents/tuscany-photography-workshop-when-fields-are-filled-with-red-poppies-may-2019/"" class=""linkified"">https://lorenphotos.com/mevents/tuscany-photography-workshop-when-fields-are-filled-with-red-poppies-may-2019/</a></p> <p>You must follow the link above to register.

(I.e., bring a laptop and/or art supplies if you think you'll work on something requiring that). Nothing messy. Buy yourself a drink and introduce yourself. Look for a stupid sign.</p> <p>~7-7:10 - If you have an idea, draw a crappy sketch of your bad idea and/or write a short description. We'll assume anyone can join your project unless you make a note saying otherwise.</p> <p>~7:10-7:30ish - Presentations of Realized Stupidity. Groups/individuals who worked on projects last time and finished them will give unstructured 2-5 min presentations. If the project is deemed totally useless, all involved will get a stupid sticker.<br/>Projects:<br/>- Mansplaining Twitterbot *on rails* - ""Well actually, it's a Mansplaining Twitterbot *on rails*""<br/>- Cat Emulator - Petting a real cat releases endorphins, petting your screen... probably doesn't.<br/>- Karen Smith from Mean Girls bot - predicts the weather using non-weather related data.<br/>- Worm Arm(s) -- Like a vest, but the opposite.</p> <p>~Afterwards, pm - we'll read through/discuss project ideas that folks submitted earlier. Then people will have the opportunity to cosponsor the stupidest ideas by signing on to them. Folks with ideas that have been co-sponsored can then start recruiting people to their ideas. People can also work on their own ideas alone if they'd prefer, but it's usually more fun to work in a group.</p> <p>- Until 8:55 - drink plenty of beer/coffee/tea, procrastinate, chat, hang out, make stupid shit with strangers. Don't be too productive. Join our slack channel to coordinate with your group so you can finish over the next few weeks if you don't finish by 8:55pm.</p> <p>9pm - Ada's closes--time to leave!

Water over time is a classic staple of landscape photography. Consider bringing both your tripod and a Neutral Density filter, although the latter is optional as we will be losing light towards the end (sunset is at 8:20). This will aid you in being able to set longer shutter speeds to capture the motion of the river.</p>",

Reports from local photographers suggest that it is a very nice place to spend an evening out with the camera. I have set Tuesday 12th May as the date but this is weather dependent. So as with all our outings, we will check in with Met Eireann two days beforehand on Sunday 12th May and decide then for certain which might be the best evening to go, so it may be that Monday or Wednesday offer better opportunities for a nice sunset. I think that depending on traffic conditions the journey can take from 75 to 90 minutes, and some car sharing can possibly be organised. Sunset is timed for 21.16 for Dublin so it will be two or three minutes later over Co. Offaly. I suggest meeting at 07.45 but of course people will arrive when they can.<br/>As I mentioned before all suggestions for venues for evening shoots during the Spring and Summer are very welcome.</p>",

Für die meisten Kulturschaffenden ist dieses Thema noch absolutes Neuland. Das ändern wir! Als Landeskulturstiftung widmet sich die Stiftung Niedersachsen in ihrem Förderprogramm „LINK – Programm für künstlerische Zukunftsforschung“ in den nächsten drei Jahren der Frage, ob und wie Künstliche Intelligenz in den einzelnen Kultursparten Anwendung finden sollte. Das Experiment beginnt mit einer Tagung für Kulturschaffende. Hier schaffen wir eine gemeinsame Grundlage zu verschiedenen Themen der Künstlichen Intelligenz wie technische Voraussetzungen, Mensch-Maschine-Kommunikation, Fragen der Kreativität und des Urheberrechts von KI. Am zweiten Tag werden in Workshops mit Experten aus Wissenschaft und Kultur Ideen zur realen Anwendung entwickelt.</p> <p>Begleiten Sie uns auf dieser experimentellen Forschungsreise!</p> <p>ANMELDUNG<br/>Die Anmeldung für die Tagung ist bis zum 30.

En esta ocasión visitaremos Tamajón, El Espinar, Roblelacasa, Campillo de Ranas, Robleluengo y Majaelrayo. Además haremos una pequeña ruta para visitar las Cascadas del Aljibe.</p> <p>Emplazada en el Parque Natural de la Sierra Norte de Guadalajara, ubicado en el cuadrante noroccidental de la Provincia, se encuentra uno de los conjuntos más impresionantes de la arquitectura popular europea: La Arquitectura Negra de Guadalajara. Un tipo de arquitectura popular que emplea como elemento constructivo principal la pizarra, compuesto mineral de tonos grises, violetas, azulados, pardos, plateados o negruzcos.</p> <p>Se trata de un grupo de pequeños y austeros pueblos que a lo largo de los tiempos han conservado su peculiar y rústica fisonomía arquitectónica. Sus sobrias construcciones se mimetizan con el entorno natural del territorio en una simbiosis casi perfecta, conformando un paisaje en perfecta armonía. La principal característica de esta arquitectura son las grandes superficies de pizarra negra que sirven tanto de cubiertas como de muros para las edificaciones, y que son extraídas del propio terreno de la zona.</p> <p>Dado el clima extremadamente frío de la comarca, con largos y duros inviernos, y de frecuentes nevadas, las viviendas, con gruesos portones de madera, son de anchos muros y aposentos pequeños, con ventanas igualmente de reducido tamaño dispuestas en la fachada sur, grandes espacios reservados para cocinas y chimeneas y división del recinto con estancias bien diferenciadas para las personas, el ganado y los productos de la tierra. Además de las casas, cobertizos, iglesias, puentes, apriscos para el ganado y cercados, vienen a completar un conjunto arquitectónico de enorme belleza y singularidad.</p> <p>Al finalizar la actividad tomaremos unas cañas/cafés para descansar y comentar la experiencia, antes de despedirnos 😉</p> <p>Precio de la actividad, 12€ por persona. Grupo mínimo 8 / máximo 15 personas.</p> <p>• Lo que hay que llevar<br/>~ Comida y bebida.

We will photograph flowers primarily but there will be opportunities to photograph the grounds, buildings and other objects of interest. Yes, there are birds and squirrels around too. You should check out the web site to get more insight into The Huntington. <a href=""https://www.huntington.org/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.huntington.org/</a> The Japanese Garden/Pavilion, succulent garden and orchid garden are amazing. The place is too big to see everything in one day. You will, however, get the idea if you haven't experienced this magnificent Library and Garden. Cost: Adults $25 (19-64 yrs old); Seniors (65 ) Bathrooms available and we will eat at The Huntington. You can bring your own food or purchase food on the grounds. Note: if you want to go into some of the art buildings you are welcome to do so only no tripods, monopods or flash photography. You may want to do building/art exploring after our photography outing. Also, there is an excellent store for purchasing memorabilia. DETAILS sturdy shoes; broad brim hat; comfortable clothing it can get warm, tripod, remote, 100mm, a lens that you can use for close ups 24x70mm works; a 70x200 would work too. I will bring a 100mm, 24x70 and a 70x200mm with an extender; polarizer to get a nicer sky blue if the opportunity warrants the use of a polarizer. Extra camera is good but adds more weight to your back pack that you should bring. Bring extra memory and batteries just in case; cell phone photography is fine too.</p>",

We will then have hands on time to demonstrate and to work with various types of flash accessories and settings.</p> <p>You may have heard that flash is too hard to use, too complicated, and that it makes photos look washed out and artificial. In this meetup, we're going to look at how and when to use a flash, demonstrate that settings are a lot simpler than they seem and prove that a flash can enhance a photograph, while making it look like natural light. We will look at when a flash can improve a photograph and when a flash should not be used. Most of the meetup will be hands on and we will look at diffusers, reflectors, better beamers, and other, inexpensive devices. Bring your camera and flash. If you don’t have one, we will have some to share.</p> <p>Monthly Critique:</p> <p>You can submit photos from a recent meetup, related to the monthly meeting topic or any other photograph you want critiqued. Limit: three photos per member. (You can bring a couple more, in case we have more time to view photographs)</p> <p>PS: everyone is encouraged to share a photograph. Please bring it on a flash drive to the meeting. It is by sharing our work and getting constructive criticism that we grow as photographers... :)</p> <p>See you there...</p> <p>The leadership team.</p>",

That little voice inside your head constantly asking...is this working...does this look good...is it compelling...is it my best work?</p> <p>Having come from a job where I had 15 other photographers to turn around and ask those questions to and get immediate feedback...I yearn for that critique, the honesty of a comrade in developer and fixer (or for the new age- a comrade in pixels) to help me improve my craft and forge my vision into a force of self expression and engagement.</p> <p>This will be a night to be courageous and put your images out there for peers to view, love, praise, and polish.</p> <p>Each image maker will bring 1 photo (or email it to Erik at [masked]). Make sure the image is at least 1420px on the longest size. Let me know if you need help with your image sizing especially if you are presenting an iPhone image.</p> <p>Some Tips on How to Critique:</p> <p>Stop, Look, Understand, Critique - This is to start a dialogue not be mean or to show how much you know about photography. People are coming here to improve. Be fair, kind and direct.</p> <p>A Critique Is Not an Opinion</p> <p>Art is full of subjective quantities. It's also full of objective quantities. Focus on the latter. There's nothing wrong with expressing a personal preference, so long as it's framed as a preference and not a critique. Critiques should focus on factually based characteristics. If someone chose to color tone a photograph a certain way, you can certainly express your preference for another color palette, but you can't argue the superiority of one or another. If someone presents a blurry shot, there are objective, measurable quantities such as shutter speed, aperture, and ISO that can be invoked to discuss why the shot was blurry and how it can be remedied.</p> <p>Also, come to the critique with an open mind. Every one has an objective opinion about art, but if 3 or more people have the same opinion it might need be taken into consideration...Too Positive or Too Negative..ignore it. Most important to consider...are you ready to have this image critiqued...</p> <p>If you cannot critique someones work, how can you be ready to have yours critiqued. Have courage to critique and confidence to build on your critiques.</p> <p>This group will of course morph and grow. Suggestions are wanted and loved.</p> <p>Erik Holladay-McCann will be our moderator. He will help guide and encourage the critique. We will not allow personal attacks on the image makers themselves. This is a space for caring for our fellow image makers, expanding our perfection of the craft, and most of all building a community that lifts us all to the next level in our photography. A rising tide carries all ships....</p>",

Over 15 years, in five Asian countries (Bhutan, China, India, Mongolia, Myanmar), Oliver Klink photographed environmental portraits of the continuity between family, work, and spirituality. There was no separation, but peoples’ concerns about how ‘progress’ can create disconnection and alienation between themselves and their communities became more evident. This fluidity of life is at the core of Cultures in Transition.</p> <p>Oliver Klink will discuss the stories behind the project, the rewards/challenges of working on a long-term project, and what turned this into an award-winning book and traveling exhibit.

Presentation will begin at 7:15 pm.</p> <p>Photographic Artists make Photographic Art, not take them, shoot them, capture them or snap them. They see the world differently and then show others how they see and feel the world. The final artistic print is their representation of the world through their eyes, mind, heart and creative artistic talents. The tools of the craft are a camera and a lens but the print is result of their artistic vision.</p> <p>Ansel Adams wrote in one of his books that the image taken in the field, although very reliant on proper technique, was merely the canvas from which to work his darkroom artistic magic.</p> <p>Digital images are imported to Photoshop or other editing software. Optimization takes place including the digital blending of different versions of an image and completely separate images.</p> <p>Photographic software was introduced 20 years ago. Today photographic artists create new and intriguing works of art and most galleries and museums have come to respect and exhibit digital art. Photographers creating artful prints have always used the tools available to them to “create” their vision of a scene, a subject or an entirely new re-presentation of reality.</p> <p>John will present Three Stages of photographic skill development with examples for each stage and a demonstration of layers for composites to demonstrate how a person gets from the photo to Artistic Photography.</p> <p>Stage 1 - Skills Development - In Camera and Simple Enhancements<br/>Stage 2 - Artistic Photography<br/>Stage 3 - Digital</p> <p>About John—<br/>In 1980 John started using photography in connection to his art background to create color images. By 1984 black and white prints became his specialty. Today, John uses photography to create fine art black and white and color prints expressing his thoughts and artistic vision. Until 1990, 35mm was his preferred film format. Today John uses medium format, large format negatives and digital files to bring a new and different look to his work. A uniqueness of composition, contrasts, colors and tones comes from formal art training at age 11. Formal art courses continued through his undergraduate studies. Although photography was not the first medium used as an expression of creativity, the early artistic training combined with photography gives his images a unique visual and emotional presentation. Studies with such noted photographers as Howard Bond, John Sexton and Dan Anderson provided training in the style of photography taught by Ansel Adams in the Owens Valley Workshops. John''s current works include color prints, black and white prints, warm brown sepia toned prints and hand tinted prints. John was President of the Chicago Area Camera Clubs Association in 1990. This organization consisted of 40 clubs in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. He became the Chairman of the Chicago Area Photographic School from 1986 to 1990. Co-founded the not-for-profit American Photographic Academy dedicated to Education In The Art Of Photography and provided two day workshops with John Sexton, Jerry Ulesman and others.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you on May 15th.</p>",

Hence do bring a bagpack that you can carry along when climbing the stairs.</p> <p>Did you know?</p> <p>If you’re looking to burn calories, lose weight and strengthen and tone major muscle groups, stair climbing provides astounding results. It is widely regarded as one of the most efficient and effective cardio and strength building workouts today.</p> <p>Cardio/Calorie Benefits</p> <p>Burn more calories climbing stairs. It engages the body’s largest muscle groups to repeatedly lift your body weight up, step after step. Using your largest muscles to carry your own weight uphill is far superior to exercising on a flat treadmill when it comes to work performed and calories burned.</p> <p>Strength and Muscle Toning Benefits</p> <p>The simple act of maintaining balance engages core muscles with every step, building strength and endurance . Tone and sculpt your entire lower body. Stair climbing engages every major muscle in your lower body as many as 120+ times/minute: glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps and calves. High repetitions are famous for building lean muscle and burning fat which results in toned and sculpted muscles. You can achieve high work efforts while moving at very low speeds relative to other workout options, minimizing the toll/stress on the body.</p>",
