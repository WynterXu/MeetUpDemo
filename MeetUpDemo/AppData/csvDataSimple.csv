This is a time to connect with your fellow photographers to discuss what and where you've been shooting and get answers to any photography questions or problems you've been having. Great way to start out your day talking photography! If we finish up early, we could plan head out from there for a shoot. Post any ideas you might have.</p> <p>If you can't get enough of talking photography, you are welcome to attend either group. This will have the same informal feel as Dave's meetup in Midlothian but if you have a specific question to discuss, post in the comments and we'll take care of it.</p> <p>This is a great introduction to RPMG for your friends interested in photography. Bring a guest!</p>",

Everyone is welcome, beginner, pro and all of us in between. Bring your questions and get real answers from certified teachers, working professionals and retired pros. Every Tuesday we show on a HUGE screen, tutorials on software, explain how to get discounts on gear from B &amp; H Photos and discounted software as well.</p> <p>This meetup has been going strong for over 7 years and averages 15 plus members at each meeting. Many of the regulars don't RSVP, so if you're joining us for the first time, please don't worry about the low RSVP count. We have a great time at this weekly meetup and I hope you'll join us for some fun, learning and great coffee and snacks</p> <p>Bring prints, DVD's, or Thumb Drives and we'll review pictures and enjoy our favorite hot/cold beverage. Come early or come late for the many exciting images shown by members and guest. All are welcome.</p> <p>Questions are welcome and if you have specific questions on your camera or lens, please bring them with you (and your owners manual).
