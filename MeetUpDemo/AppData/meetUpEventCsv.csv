Great way to start out your day talking photography! If we finish up early, we could plan head out from there for a shoot. Post any ideas you might have.</p> <p>If you can't get enough of talking photography, you are welcome to attend either group.

To have your images critiqued, make them 6x9"" 120PPI JPEG and upload them into the correct folder under the Photo's Tab.</p> <p>We have a project designed to develop an appreciation of image processing. Where some say they only want to snap pictures and not be bothered with image processing, they just don't understand how much better their images can be with just a little time spent on their image. So, upload an image just out of the camera and the same image after processing. They are to be loaded into the Before &amp; After folder.</p> <p>We are doing an exercise where we all will process the same image to see how differently each may do their processing. I have sent an image out to the members who were at the last meeting. They will process the image and upload it into the Hobie 50 Image Processing folder. If you want to participate, send me an e-mail ([masked]) and I will send you the image.</p> <p>Hope you can make it to the meeting and one of our meet-up's and trips.</p> <p>By the way, I have three Canon lens to give away at the meeting.</p>",

The weather forecast is calling for rain off and on throughout the day with a strong chance of thunderstorms this evening. When we determine the new date we’ll post it on our calendar. Thank you.</p> <p>Come join us for a memorial guided walking tour to remember the 44th anniversary of the ending of the Vietnam War and honor our veterans.</p> <p>Did you know ….</p> <p>There are 58,318 names inscribed on “The Wall,” including 8 women.<br/>Saigon fell to North Vietnamese Communists on April 30, 1975.</p> <p>U.S. Marine Corporal Charles McMahon &amp; U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Darwin Lee Judge were the last two United States servicemen killed in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The two men, both U.S. Marines, were killed in a rocket attack one day before the Fall of Saigon.</p> <p>Thirty years earlier, on September 26, 1945, the first American was killed in Vietnam, Army Lieutenant Colonel Albert Peter Dewey of the OSS (the predecessor of today’s CIA).</p> <p>Many Americans killed during the Vietnam War, or who died as a result of their service in Vietnam, are not listed on the wall (will explain why during our program).</p> <p>Six Presidents (3 Democrats and 3 Republicans) faced the challenges of Vietnam: Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford.</p> <p>The focus of our program will be a better understanding of the complexities of the Vietnam War and we’ll be spending the majority of our time at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.</p> <p>To provide some historical context our program will start at the World War II Memorial and also visit the Korean Memorial so that we can see how those wars, and their memorials, compare and contrast to Vietnam.</p> <p>Because Vietnam received a tremendous amount of press overage, we’ll also briefly explore the role of media during the war, including the stories behind the “most famous photos of the Vietnam War.”</p> <p>Depending on how many people attend this event our program may vary from being a moderately-sized guided “tour” to more of a “walk.” There is no maximum number of attendees and we will be presenting information via microphone, visual aids, handouts, etc. to the best of our abilities. However, depending on the size of the group, there may be challenges for some people seeing and hearing all of the material. We would rather do our best to overcome these challenges than turn anyone away. If you don’t like big groups, please stay home. If this event format is agreeable to you then we look forward to seeing you.</p> <p>___________________________________</p> <p>Registration: FREE and all are welcome to attend including children and groups. Unfortunately, National Park Service regulations do not allow non-service animals within the memorials. Since we’ll be spending the majority of our time within the memorials, and out of respect for our veterans, we ask that you kindly leave your pets at home.</p> <p>Weather: This event will take place light rain (sprinkles) or shine. If it’s on our calendar, then we’re proceeding as scheduled.</p> <p>Meeting Point: At the World War II “National Park Service Ranger Contact Station,” which is just south of the WWII Memorial on Homefront Drive SW between 17th St. and Independence Ave. FYI there is a restroom next door.</p> <p>Ending Point: The Vietnam Veterans Memorial.</p> <p>Additional Questions: Anything that can’t be answered by the above event description, Google, or common sense please let us know.</p> <p>__________________________________</p> <p>This program is presented by the non-profit community organization Washington, DC History &amp; Culture:<br/>“bringing people together to experience the history and culture of Washington, DC.”</p> <p>For more fun and educational programs visit us at:<br/><a href=""https://www.Facebook.com/DCHistoryAndCulture"" class=""linkified"">https://www.Facebook.com/DCHistoryAndCulture</a><br/><a href=""https://www.Meetup.com/DCHistoryAndCulture"" class=""linkified"">https://www.Meetup.com/DCHistoryAndCulture</a><br/><a href=""https://DCHistoryAndCulture.Eventbrite.com"" class=""linkified"">https://DCHistoryAndCulture.Eventbrite.com</a><br/><a href=""https://www.Instagram.com/DCHistoryAndCulture"" class=""linkified"">https://www.Instagram.com/DCHistoryAndCulture</a><br/>#DCHistoryAndCulture</p>",

WordPress is one of the best and most flexible option. Through its system of templates and plugins a WordPress site can be just about anything from a simple gallery system, to a blog, to a full corporate site with lead generation, ecommerce or learning management.</p> <p>During this class students will learn why they might choose WordPress, how to pick hosting and install WordPress. The class will take students through WordPress’ system of templates and customization and talk about plugins (and some of my favorites for various tasks). We will focus on dealing with images and cover several options for how to host galleries and image centric blogs and pages.</p> <p>Topics Covered</p> <p>• What is WordPress and the problems it solves for photographers<br/>• And a quick look at alternatives and how they differ<br/>• The basics of hosting for WordPress (what is managed, shared, vps hosting, etc) and what you need<br/>• Installing Wordpress (it’s easy) and configuring a basic site<br/>• WordPress Basics - Understanding Posts vs Pages, as well as Permalinks and Taxonomies.<br/>• Templates and Plugins - Customize a Site<br/>• How to pick some favorites<br/>• Dealing with Images - Several Options<br/>• Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - Just the basics.<br/>• Backups… Backups… Backups…</p> <p>Audience</p> <p>This class is perfect for photographers considering setting up a web site for the first time and individuals with the desire to go beyond the default install of WordPress.</p> <p>Schedule and Format</p> <p>This is a lecture-based class in Precision's classroom. This workshop will be approximately three-hours long with a short break in the middle. Students are encouraged to ask questions and interact throughout.</p> <p>About the Instructor</p> <p>Andrew Fritz is a self taught photographer who comes from a software engineering background. On his very first trip with a camera he discovered night photography and has never looked back. He developed his night photography skills through trial and error in environments from the near perfect darkness of west Texas to bright urban settings around Washington DC and Austin. When not making night time images, Andrew is shooting for AzulOx Visuals making a variety of images from weddings, to architecture and everything inbetween. Andrew loves solving problems but more than that, he loves sharing his knowledge with others, helping them grow.</p> <p>See more of Andrew's images at AMadTrip.com and AzulOx.com.</p> <p>You can contact Andrew with questions about the class at [masked]</p>",

I am self taught and have had no formal training in photography. Basically I went out hiking with a point and shoot camera and over the years upgraded to interchangeable lens cameras. Learning was a process in itself, reading a lot of books on photography as well as learning several editing programs. The best part was meeting some terrific photographers along the way who were kind enough to help me take better pictures. I still have much to learn though, If I see something interesting, I just take the picture, never mind the camera settings. I love editing my pictures to make them into something special and enhance their appearance.<br/>My presentation will be a general mix of of photography as I don’t specialize in any one area. I will be bringing prints ranging from collage, texturing, HDR,<br/>Landscape and nature photography. Looking forward to seeing all of you at the meeting.</p> <p>After Mary's presentation, Jerry will present photos and videos from his three week photo adventure trip to the Southwest,.</p>",

A studio photographer attends every shoot to assist new photographers and guide the smooth running of the shoot. Many shoots have a stylist, HMUA or even a collaborating brand.</p> <p>We ask photographers to tag the studio, club, models and any stylist when posting photos from the shoots. This generates some great networking and collaboration between everyone involved.</p> <p>Our shoots are great experience and portfolio builders in a relaxed friendly and supportive environment. Many photographers attend several sessions each month.</p> <p>Goto Facebook.com/groups/JunglePhotoClub on Facebook for the themes list and bookings and to share your photos with the club members and models.</p>",

If you happen to miss a day or two (life happens), it is OK to catch up and upload the photos for the days missed or just a skip those days. Please don't post over 2-3 at a time. This is part of the learning process.</p> <p>Towards the top/left of the page is a link to Add Photos for uploading your photo to the album. Remember to post your best photo (JUST ONE) you took every day each day on that day! DO NOT POST PHOTOS FROM ANY OTHER TIME! If you have time to post an older image, then you have time to take a new image and post it. Be creative.</p> <p>Please Add a Caption so you know how far you are in the process. After you upload your image you took that day, find your photo at the end of the album, edit the caption to state the day and total of days in the month like this: ?/31. You can add a title of the image if you wish. A good title can make a photo! So, your photo for January 1st caption would be ""1/31 - My great photo!"" ** Adding a caption helps you keep track of where you are in the month. It does help.</p> <p>The purpose is to have fun and get in the habit of shooting everyday. Learn your camera. Read your manual and test out a new feature you had never used before. Sometimes picking a theme can help focus (pun intended) like flowers, your pet(s), what ever is your passion. Or try something new...</p> <p>The End Date is 5/31/2019. Meetup.com does not allow events to be longer than 2 weeks.</p> <p>Other images that were not taken by you will be removed. Please keep the image family friendly. Folks need to be a member of the Virginia Beltway Photography Group.</p> <p>I look forward to see how far people go and grow as better photographers!</p>",

The Police have been managing the bridge very closely in recent years so there's unlikely to be any jumpers.</p> <p>Our usual approach is to say that we meet at first to make sure we recognise one another. We can then wander in ones or twos for a while taking pictures. If anyone would like company, or is not as confident, or has yet to get to grips with their camera, then simply say that to one of the 'organisers' and we will be happy to cruise together.</p> <p>Gail's Bakery on Little Clarendon Street was a good venue for people to reconnect last year, so we will aim to do so again at 0815.</p> <p>This is a chance to share experiences, look at each other's images (albeit unedited) and either go ""Oooh Aaah"" or offer more useful comments.</p> <p>If the festivities are still very active, we can always head back after a coffee.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>Camera!

Captain Mike is one of the very best eagle guides on the East Coast and also provides excellent narrative about the eagle's territories and history. This is a great time of year to do this. In addition to bald eagles there's a good variety of other wildlife to photograph: osprey and great blue heron (currently nesting) make for nice photos, Canada geese, egrets and double crested cormorants are fairly dependable here this time of year. Deep Bottom Park <a href=""https://henrico.us/rec/places/deep-bottom/"" class=""linkified"">https://henrico.us/rec/places/deep-bottom/</a><br/>has ample parking and nice heated public bathrooms. Dress appropriately for the weather. You may bring snacks or a thermos of coffee if you like. There is a cooler with ice and free bottled water on the boat. We will not get off the boat during the tour. The boat is a large comfortable pontoon boat with flat deck and a roof over about half of it. This is a private tour just for RPMG but can only accommodate 6 people. This is an ""early trip"" - participants must be at the parking lot at Deep Bottom by 6:45 to avoid delaying our start at 7:00 AM. Weather call is up to the Captain. If weather prevents going I will post a notification here. If we can't go on this date, we will try to scedule a makeup date.<br/>Note: There was a long waiting list the last three of these trips. The Meetup software does not allow for carrying-over a wait list to a new event - and in fact erases all names from the waitlist once the event happens. So I have no way to shift those that were on a prior wait list to this date. Sorry - each event registration is ""stand alone"". So it will be first come first served. However I ask that anyone who was on one of the prior 3 trips please step aside and let others have a chance to register for this tour.</p> <p>For shooting detailed images of eagles and other wildlife bring a long lens that reaches a focal length equivalent of at least 300mm (more is better – but be sure you are comfortable hand holding your outfit while seated – and panning to track birds in flight). A good fast autofocus system is important. Shooting distance to wildlife will range from 30' to 200'. Tripods or monopods are not needed or useful when shooting from a boat. If you don’t have a long lens there are some nice views and scenery to capture. I will offer a few set-up and shooting pointers before we leave the dock and try to help in any way I can as we go along. I can offer set-up advice but do not know how to do settings on cameras other than my own Nikons.<br/>Cost is $50 per person. Payment may be made directly to Parks or via PayPal at [masked]. Payment is not needed prior to registration - but expected within a few days after getting a spot on the ""attendee"" list.. No need to pay if you are on the wait list. Refunds will only be issued if your space is taken by someone else. The meetup software has a bug and will always show attendees as ""unpaid"". Just ignore that and look for me to post a confirmation that you have paid.</p>",

There literally is no photography related question that they can't answer.</p> <p>Perhaps the most popular segment of the meetings is the 20 to 30 minutes of each week devoted to watching award winning documentaries on select photographers from the past 100 years.  These include films on Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Paul Strand, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Cappa and many others.  Watching these documentaries is not only entertaining, but educational as you see how the masters worked at their art and craft.</p> <p>Another popular segment is our ""Show &amp; Tell"" segment where members bring a few (10 to 25) recent images on a flash drive.  Then we project them on our big screen with our state of the art digital projector.</p> <p>You're welcome to narrate or just let the images show on the screen.  If you want a few images critiqued, no problem, just say so. Jeff will be happy to offer words of encouragement and helpful suggestions to improve the photograph.</p> <p>If you want to show a few photos, just add them in JPEG format to a USB Flash Drive (sometimes referred to as a Thumb Drive) and give them to Jeff at the start of the meeting.</p> <p>This meeting is extremely popular with the regular members and many don't bother to RSVP.  We regularly have 40 or more members in attendance.  It's OK to come late and leave early if necessary, so don't worry about traffic or being late.</p> <p>Everyone is also invited to lunch following each meeting.  We visit several of most popular Clearwater restaurants on a rotating basis after each weekly meeting. This is a great way to meet other members, learn about FCCP and get involved in the photography community.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>My Recommended Retailers</b></p> <p>Where you buy your gear matters.

See below for a list of our usual venues.</p> <p>Who: We generally have at least 15-20 people on each hike, though we've had as many as 30+. We are a friendly group and do our best to make newcomers feel welcome. Dogs are welcome everywhere we hike except Sawnee Preserve, but are required to be on a leash at all times.</p> <p>Intended Difficulty/Fitness-level: The locations and trails chosen for this hike, as well as the hiking pace, are of moderate difficulty. Each hike will be between 4 and 5 miles, and we will hike that distance in about 2 hours.<br/>We will pause briefly a few times for water breaks or to catch our breath. Most of our hikes have hill climbing involved, so these are NOT Easy or Beginner hikes. So this is a moderate hike all around, of about 2.5mph pace. But this is also not intended to be a hard-core ""workout"" hike - if you prefer to hike very fast (e.g. 3mph or faster pace) our experience is that you will be frustrated with the pacing of this hike.</p> <p>Lunch afterward: While not required or expected, please join us for lunch afterward at a local restaurant. Restaurants chosen will be of moderate price level (e.g Taco Mac, Taqueria Tsunami, barbecue joints, etc.).</p> <p>Please consider an optional Membership donation will help us pay our Meetup expenses and continue to provide exciting new outings each month.

Home to over 2000 stone arches carved by millennia of natural forces, Arches National Park is a photographer’s paradise.</p> <p>Join professional photographer’s Jamie MacDonald, and Mark Miller on a 3-day adventure photographing some of Arches National Park’s most iconic features. 3 days of awe-inspiring sunrises, sunsets, mid-day excursions, astrophotography, all of which promises to send every attendee home with images that can only be described as epic. With two instructors available, every attendee is guaranteed to get the personal level of attention they deserve and require to make the best images possible. Workshop attendees will also enjoy the in-workshop transportation provided by Jamie and Mark. This group transportation allows workshop attendees to get to know one another while relaxing during the travel between locations and helps to create a group bond that often results in friendships that last long after the workshop is done.</p> <p>This workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and all ages.<br/>Physical requirements are some light to moderate walking, with distances no longer than 1 mile each way to a feature. There may be some elevation changes during these walks, but nothing requiring any hiking experience.</p> <p>Jamie MacDonald is a member of the Olympus Visionary Program, Vanguard Professional, and NiSi Filters Brand Ambassador. Jamie has been leading photography workshops around the U.S. for 5 years and his passion for photography is only matched by his passion to teach.</p> <p>Mark Miller is a Vanguard Professional, NiSi Filter Brand Ambassador, a workshop leader with more than 2 years experience leading workshops.</p> <p>Complete details can be found on the event registration page at:<br/><a href=""https://events.eventzilla.net/e/moab-through-the-lens-2138707884"" class=""linkified"">https://events.eventzilla.net/e/moab-through-the-lens-2138707884</a></p> <p>Thank you and we look forward to capturing Arches National Park with you in May!</p> <p>Why attend a workshop with Jamie and Mark?</p>",

Set up shots with someone posing are also fun - children, couples, families - all fun subjects. Try to upload 3 very different images. A person at work, a candid, a child at play, for instance. Branch out and try new things.</p> <p>Learn to photograph people in the best light - do a little research and practice watching the light. Figure out how the light will flatter your subject.</p> <p>Upload 1-3 of your best PEOPLE photos.<br/>Comment on 2-3 for each image you post. Be kind and creative in your comments - it's all about being supportive and yet giving some guidance. What caught your attention? is there an emotional impact? Mention the composition - if you like it or if you might like it tweaked. Comment on something that you think might make the image stronger.</p> <p>Here are some links to look at to help you get better at photographing people:</p> <p><a href=""https://africageographic.com/blog/10-tips-for-photographing-people/"" class=""linkified"">https://africageographic.com/blog/10-tips-for-photographing-people/</a></p> <p><a href=""https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-people-7-tips-for-photographers-who-never-photograph-people/"" class=""linkified"">https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-people-7-tips-for-photographers-who-never-photograph-people/</a></p> <p><a href=""http://www.digital-photo-secrets.com/tip/5499/photograph-people-work/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.digital-photo-secrets.com/tip/5499/photograph-people-work/</a></p>",

But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And no athletic skill is necessary, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!</p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf"" class=""linkified"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf</a></p> <p>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.</p> <p>The important stuff...</p> <p>• This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up.

Toby has always considered himself lucky. Was his 'luck' due to innate charm or was it more a product of privilege? When the secret of a wych elm forces Toby to face who he is, he discovers the truth hiding in plain sight. 'The Witch Elm' is Irish (set in Dublin) and it's long--so budget enough time to read it, and have your Irish-English dictionary handy. (jacks=loo, amn't=aren't; simple things that could be clues.) :-)</p> <p>Each meeting we will pick apart a recent novel from various genres with the goal of uncovering how the author has utilized their skills to great effect. Storytelling is an art, but it's not a mystery. Every writer must address the following:</p> <p>- Structure, Timeline, Pacing, Suspense, Omission<br/>- Point of View, including Voice, Character, Place<br/>- Tense, Argot, Imagery, Metaphor, Symbols<br/>- Motivation: Making a story pop - generating a thrill<br/>- Why this story? And why now? Industry considerations</p> <p>We ask that all attendees read the novel in advance of the meeting, and come bearing their discoveries of how the author has addressed each of the five points above.</p> <p>How does 'literary forensics' work?

Cantigny (pronounced can-TEEN-nee) boasts architecture, formal gardens, walkways and water features. We will attempt to uncover the details within the big picture. Shadows, curves, leading lines, repetition - these are just some of the elements that lend to great composition. So, let's see what we can learn as we wander the grounds together, channeling our awareness of shape and form. and yes the garden renovations are complete!</p> <p>We will meet at the entrance to the visitor center. Parking on free as it is the first Wednesday of the month vs $10.00 per car on other weekend days. Per usual, we will spend a fair amount of time shooting and then meet in the park cafe to review our artistry. There are no prerequisites for this one.

The paper slides out of the printer and you discover that a real print, one that you made from capture to finished fine-art print has depth and quality that no monitor can match. It's almost a religious experience. Exceptional prints are the ultimate expression of photographic art.</p> <p>Printing your own images is a transformative experience, but it is also fraught with pitfalls that can be frustrating to work out on your own. With a little help, you can avoid the pitfalls and catapult directly to the joy of seeing your photography in the real world on archival paper.</p> <p>Modern high-end inkjet printers can produce a range of color and tone unmatched by any screen. Paper selection adds an entire dimension to the display of your art. Of course, printing can be intimidating: pigment vs ink? paper types? What about color profiles? Sometimes it's hard to know where to start.</p> <p>During this class, Andrew will take the class through editing and printing image using both Lightroom and Capture One. The class will cover the basics of inkjet printer tech, paper choice and color profiles for print.</p> <p>Each student will get the chance to print one of their own images as well (bring an edited JPG on an SD card or USB key).</p> <p>Topics Covered<br/>• Basics of Ink Jet Print Technology - Ink v Pigment, Color Mixing, etc.<br/>• Paper Choices<br/>• Color Profiles and Printing<br/>• Prepping and Printing Images from Lightroom &amp; Capture One (Live Printing Demo)<br/>• Hands-On Student Prints (1 per student)</p> <p>Audience<br/>This is an all levels class perfect for photographers interested in printing their own photos. It is also suited for photographers struggling to develop an effective print-based workflow.</p> <p>Schedule and Format<br/>This is a demonstration based class with a small hands-on portion at the end. The first 30 minutes of class will be used to cover the technical background (tech, paper, profiles). This will be<br/>followed by a live printing demo working from RAW files to finished files. Finally, students will be invited to print their own photos (SD or Thumb drive, RAW or JPG) with Andrew's help.</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Andrew Fritz is a self-taught photographer who comes from a software engineering background. On his very first trip with a camera, he discovered night photography and has never looked back. He developed his night photography skills through trial and error in environments from the near perfect darkness of west Texas to bright urban settings around Washington DC and Austin. When not making nighttime images, Andrew is shooting for AzulOx Visuals making a variety of images from weddings, to architecture and everything in between. Andrew loves solving problems but more than that, he loves sharing his knowledge with others, helping them grow.</p> <p>See more of Andrew's images at AMadTrip.com and AzulOx.com.</p> <p>You can contact Andrew with questions about the class at [masked]</p>",

This month Lightroom Product Manager Benjamin Warde (hey, that's me!) will present an overview of the new(ish) cloud-connected Lightroom - NOT Lightroom Classic. Make sure you read that previous sentence carefully so you know what you're signing up for. ;-)</p> <p>Have you been curious about this new Lightroom, but not quite known what the heck it is, where to start, or whether or not it might be for you? Come to this meeting and all will be answered. I will give a complete overview of Lightroom, showing off all its strengths and possibilities, and shedding some light on how it differs from Lightroom Classic. (As a side note, this will be an adapted version of a class that I taught this past year at Adobe MAX. Adobe MAX is a creativity conference that people pay thousands of dollars to attend, and you get it for free! Plus pizza!)</p> <p>If you are unable to attend in person you can join the live stream at <a href=""https://bluejeans.com/4085364227"" class=""linkified"">https://bluejeans.com/4085364227</a> Please ONLY RSVP if you will be attending in person - do not RSVP if you will be attending online (I use the RSVP numbers to know how much pizza to order).</p> <p>Note that contrary to what I said at our last meeting in December, this meeting will be held at our usual location. We'll have pizza and socializing from 6:30 to 7:00, the presentation will go from 7:00 to 8:00, and we'll have time for questions from 8:00 to 8:30.</p> <p>Please be aware that there is a San Francisco Giants game this night! That will likely affect traffic in the area.</p> <p>I hope to see you all there!</p>",

This hike will also bring you to the unprotected edge of a waterfall (although you can easily keep your distance and still get good photos).</p> <p>Always watch your step and DO NOT move your feet while looking through your camera.

It remained there for 25 years, was only recently transported back to LA and is now on exhibit for the first time in the new tower gallery.</p> <p>Also returned from Spain is another glass artwork that is an assemblage of unusual details depicting certain aspects of LA's socio-anthropological history, from an auction book of what was salvaged from a long-lost pier amusement park in Santa Monica that was destroyed by fire, to a list of the top pop hits of southern California during summer of 1966.</p> <p>Further, on exhibit is a series of thematically related digitally-generated artworks depicting abstractions of subway maps of various cities worldwide.</p> <p>Last but not least, a big surprise will be awaiting upon ascending the tower's interactive sound stairway, underground ghosts and all!</p> <p>-----------</p> <p>The central theme of the show concerns aesthetic reinterpretations of functional transportation maps and systems.</p> <p>Today, as we all experience, LA has the world's worst traffic congestion. Hoping that we will all choke on exhaust fumes, the city chose to make bike lanes that hardly anyone uses taking up space that previously was intended for cars. A new snail-slow evolving metro system will take decades to be truly useful in connecting many neighborhoods of the sprawling city. Beating the traffic for many means getting around on electric scooters, which are not intended for more than neighborhood transportation.</p> <p>Abrams missed a great deal of not just LA's but the United States' changes, while he lived in Europe from 1987 until 2012, where he never owned an automobile. In its place is the experience and knowledge he gained upon adopting certain European habits and sensibilities, while riding metros, tramways and walking. In presenting his work, he will lead a discussion concerning how our daily lives are impacted by the realities of local transportation.</p> <p>NOTE: The address of the meeting will be sent privately to salon attendees.</p>",

All beginners welcome! Everyone needs to start somewhere, right? :)</p> <p>We can teach you how to say ""What's __ in Japanese or English"" so that you can continue to speak as much in the language you are learning as possible!</p> <p>With this event we will put a stop to your inability to practice the language you are learning simply because the person you're talking to is able to speak your native tongue better than you can in their's! Bring some friends who have been suffering along side you and let's get in some REAL life language practice!!</p> <p>Hope to see you there! XD</p> <p>What to bring:</p> <p>1. For Japanese, a one note contribution of just 1000 yen to assist in organising and keeping this group running :). For native English speakers, we are asking for a contribution at this point of just 500 yen. I'd like to be able to buy our group any resources that we need to make our language exchange experience better through this too, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know :). This group will be help kept running by the caring people who support Andy and I in making Shizuoka prefecture an exciting place to live with lots of active, fun events! Without you we couldn't keep making these events so we really appreciate your support!</p> <p>2.

An intergalactic warrior joins a cosmic Christ figure in battle against a demonic eight-year-old girl and her pet hawk, while the fate of the universe hangs in the balance!</p> <p>One of the holiest of all Holyfuckingshits, THE VISITOR is a wonderful mishmash of THE OMEN, THE BIRDS, ROSEMARY’S BABY, STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS — but even that barely hints at the fervor with which director Giulio Paradisi hurls his cast (John Huston, Glenn Ford, Shelley Winters, Franco Nero, Lance Henriksen and, yes, even Sam Peckinpah) into the cinematic void.</p> <p>Just when you think you’ve nailed down which direction the film’s heading in, THE VISITOR shatters your notion of the time-space continuum with a blackhearted blowout of interplanetary possession, telekinetic avian assault, exploding basketballs and ecclesiastical laserstorms. If you miss out on this one, then you have as much regard for cinema as you do for a discarded toenail clipping.</p> <p>“[It wows] cult fans, connoisseurs of the absurd, and cinephiles intrigued by the evolution of the sci-fi and horror genres in the ’70s and ’80s.” BOSTON GLOBE</p> <p>“Perhaps the most fun you can have in a movie theater without risking permanent brain damage.” FILM.COM</p> <p>“…The Visitor is unique in that while it fails in most every traditional respect with regard to narrative clarity or construction, it doesn’t fall short as either entertainment or as a piece of craftsmanship. In fact, it excels at both, and as a result endures as one of the era’s most indefinable, inconceivably progressive pieces of cinematic nonsense.” SLANT</p>",

I just had to confirm the speaker for next weeks meeting. After a couple of cancellations, we do have a speaker for our May meeting. Our speaker, who I must thank for doing this without much notice, is Dale Walde. Dale will share his experiences and images on a recent trip to Ireland. Here is the link to Dale's website: www.dragonlightphotography.org</p> <p>Our June meeting will be our annual outdoor model shoot. This is a great opportunity to practice our posing and lighting techniques. There may be a small charge for the meeting to help cover model and location fees. If you are interested in attending the June meeting, please let me know so we can book enough models for the shoot.</p> <p>The photography theme for the month of May is ""BLACK &amp; WHITE"" . Open to your interpretation. Try and be creative. This is a good way to learn and share with your photography. Bring in your best shot for the theme and one image in the open category as well. 8X10 prints or larger are best for visual impact.</p> <p>We will continue with the critique of the submitted images. Excellent feedback and some great comments with this format. We will have 2 judges give constructive feedback on your images. They will give their view of your image. This doesn't make them right, but may allow you to look at your own image from a different perspective. The peanut gallery is more than welcome to make comments after the 2 judges have made their comments.</p> <p>For those of you that would like to bring a print for the critique, but don't have the time to get it printed. Blake Chapman has graciously offered to print your image and bring it to the meeting. Here are the details: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Photographic-Society/messages/boards/thread/49402659#[masked]"" class=""linkified"">http://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Photographic-Society/messages/boards/thread/49402659&#35;[masked]</a></p> <p>If you have a image that you have brought into one of the meetings, please add it into the photo gallery. There is a gallery set up for the Theme, and one for all Open images. It would be nice to have a gallery of images to look back at for future reference.</p> <p>The $30.00 that we charge is for your dues for the year. If you are attending the monthly meetings we will collect this once a year. Additional fees may apply to workshops and outings and will be collected when the event is being held.</p> <p>This Meetup is to help educate and inspire you. Come out and get involved. Thank you.</p> <p>That's all for now.<br/>See you at the meeting.</p>",

They happen to be the same owners of the venue where we held the inaugural VPW Photo Exhibition three years ago in the industrial / warehouse / studio complex on the French Broad River. They have since moved to more-accessible location, into a very nice space on Patton Avenue</p> <p>This meeting will be an opportunity for interested vagabond photographers to see the space, and to discuss the details of the show. The only thing confirmed at this point is that the theme will be ""WNC in Black &amp; White"". It is not a certainty that we will do the show at this location, but given that time is running on, and it is difficult to locate a host venue for this summer, there is a good chance that the show will be at this West Asheville location.</p> <p>Texture Gallery &amp; Art Bar Website: <a href=""https://www.textureartbar.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.textureartbar.com/</a></p> <p>Address: 1516 Patton Avenue, Asheville, NC</p> <p>You will see from the website that the gallery is not only a colorful, funky, and fun gallery space, but they also provide printing and framing services out of that location, which may make it much less stressful for participants to get their artwork together.</p> <p>This MeetUp event will be used to show everyone the space and its possibilities and to get the ball rolling with respect to details. Discussion topics will include:</p> <p>• Determine overall interest in doing a show</p> <p>• Confirm dates for the show, opening and closing receptions, art drop off, etc.</p> <p>• Discuss marketing / publicizing of the event</p> <p>• Image content / theme (e.g., All images should be from our photo walks, and be presented in B&amp;W)</p> <p>• Printing, matting, framing, etc. options</p> <p>• Selection of art for the show</p> <p>• Artwork pricing, selling and venue commission</p> <p>• Volunteers to help with everything</p> <p>* Confirm ""entry fee"" to cover reception expenses, etc.</p> <p>* Any other ideas / concerns</p> <p>We will kick off the meeting at 6:00pm with a 30-minute ""social"" (BYOB), then get into the meeting agenda at 6:30pm sharp (which will be chaired by me, David Simchock - MeetUp organizer). The meeting should be wrapped up by 7:30pm. We've done this before, so I expect a very efficient meeting.</p> <p>You do not have to attend the social, but this will give you time to check out the space, and to mingle with fellow vagabonds.</p> <p>This is a fantastic opportunity for everyone in the MeetUp, especially after a string of successful shows the past three summers. All members are welcome to participate, and all skill levels are welcome.</p> <p>Depending on the level of interest, we may have to establish a maximum number of participants (although the gallery space is plenty big for our expected needs). If this is the case, participants will be ""selected"" on a first-come, first-served basis once the formal MeetUp exhibition event is posted (which will require payment). There will be no exceptions to this (i.e., spots will not be reserved for anybody -- sorry!).</p> <p>If you are interested in showing your work, please do your best to attend this meeting. Thanks for your interest!</p> <p>IF YOU HAVE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SHOW, PLEASE POST THEM AS COMMENTS TO THIS EVENT.</p> <p>I hope that every one is as excited as I am about this special opportunity.</p> <p>Kind regards.</p> <p>- David Simchock (MeetUp Organizer)</p>",

If you haven’t then you’re certainly not alone!</p> <p>Built in 1975 the gem sits hidden in North Glenmore Athletic Park.<br/>The track is 400 metres in length and features 29 degree banks. The turns on a velodrome are usually ""banked,"" or constructed at an angle, and the banking on some of the shorter tracks can reach such incredible angles that it would seem impossible for anyone to ride a bike on them. However, the centrifugal force generated by the riders' speed usually keeps them firmly glued to the track's surface no matter how steep the banking may be.<br/>If you have never been, this is something you have to see to believe.</p> <p>For a great opportunity to shoot some amazing photographs, come join us at North Glenmore Athletic Park on May 2nd to shoot some action packed bike races. While at the track we will have the opportunity to shoot along the perimeter of the track,as well as capturing some shots within the midfield. Given the size of the track there are no limitations as to where we will be able to shoot.<br/>You will however want to bring your best zoom lenses to avoid long walks!</p> <p>Please meet us at the bleachers of the track at 6:00 p.m to setup the cameras and to discuss best shooting practices.</p> <p>See you then!</p>",

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UtHO6h"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UtHO6h</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>Transport:</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 9:55 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

Please keep your suggestions coming in!</p> <p>What 's tricky about this particular Meetup Class is that it's hard to predict when the Cherry Blossoms are going to turn out the beautiful Blooms!? So I will post two classes.. This one (Thursday May 2nd) and I'll post a second Class on (Tuesday May 7th). If the blooms are not ready on the 2nd, we'll aim for the 7th! One way or the other, I will keep both meetups open to shoot!</p> <p>This meetup will be about composition and being creative. There's many ways to photograph a beautiful park landscape.. and it really doesn't matter if you have a large professional camera, or a simple android cell phone.. This meetup is about getting outside in the fresh outdoors, mingling with like minded creatives, and smelling the beautiful aromas of the cherry blossoms.</p> <p>After this class, you will have the confidence and tools to continue to take amazing memorable photographs!</p> <p>Let's all meet 5-10 minutes early at the park Gazebo Close to the Waterpark. (This location to be confirmed)</p> <p>Gear List:</p> <p>Fully Charged Cell Phone + Portable cell phone tripod and mount OR cell phone selfie stick. Tripod and Stick helpful but not necessary.<br/>DSLR or Point and Shoot.

Some of them are poignant, beautiful, funny and nostalgic. Time and time again we are reminded of how Nature never ceases to surprise and how quickly time does go by.</p> <p>Main Program: On January 1st, 2014, Dorian Anderson boarded his bicycle for an eco-friendly twist on the classic birdwatching Big Year, a project during which a birdwatcher tries to maximize the number of bird species observed during a calendar year. Where his predecessors utilized cars, planes, boats, and even helicopters, Anderson used only a bicycle, and in the 12 months following his departure he pedaled 18,000 miles through 28 states in search of birds. He saw the country like no birder before him, overcame immeasurable physical and mental challenges, and found an incredible 618 species by year’s end.</p> <p>Anderson will speak about the genesis of the trip and why he decided to resign his long-standing scientific career to pursue the project. He’ll provide a recount of his travels, and his personality and enthusiasm will be on full display as he spins tales of birds, bicycles, extreme weather, landscapes, and everything else he encountered on America’s roads. His story should not be missed!</p> <p>Dorian Anderson started birding in his family backyard in Philadelphia at age seven, and his interest grew to encompass the Delaware Valley and Jersey Shore during his preteen years. He attended several of Victor Emanuel’s youth birding camps as a teenager and was a very active birder until the responsibilities of boarding school pushed the interest into the background.</p> <p>He attended Stanford University where he studied Biochemisty and Molecular Biology and he worked in the department of Molecular Biology at Harvard University after graduation. In 2004, he moved to New York to begin his doctorate in Developmental Genetics and Molecular Cell Biology at NYU. He completed that degree in 2010 and moved back to Boston for a post-doctoral fellowship in Molecular Neuroscience at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. However, by the end of 2012 he decided academic science was no longer his calling and wanted to reconnect with his childhood birding passion. He resigned his position in the middle of 2013 and began preparing for his Big Year adventure.</p> <p>Momentum from that project opened up many doors including public speaking, travel writing, and tour guiding. He recently spent two months working with the Audubon Society in Colombia, and he leads pelagic trips when home in San Francisco. He is an accomplished bird photographer, and is working to finish a book about his bike-birding adventure.</p>",

His images have been published in National Geographic, Time Magazine, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and others. He was a staff photographer for the Boston Globe for 12 years. While there, he received national and international accolades for his coverage of the Columbine Shooting, the Boston Marathon Bombing, the Newtown Massacre, the Indonesia Tsunami aftermath, and coverage of the war in Iraq. He has also received awards for portrait, food, product, and travel photography.</p> <p>Suarez, who was born in Panama, was raised by his grandparents and an uncle. As a child he would sit for hours in his uncle’s drugstore poring over magazines. National Geographic was his favorite, and this planted the seed for what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.<br/>He started studying journalism at the University of Florida, specializing in writing for magazines with a minor in zoology. But words were not his form of expression – he needed to find another way.</p> <p>A chance meeting with the photo director of National Geographic ignited his passion for photography. He switched his major and ended up getting an internship with National Geographic out of that meeting. He spent time in the jungles of Panama, Costa Rica, and Colombia. He was hooked.</p> <p>Essdras claims not to be a specialist, but rather a generalist in his vocation, but his favorite genres are street and travel photography. He loves documenting “normalcy” – making the normal look extraordinary. He has taken photographs in about 60 countries. His mantra is, “Look at the world through others’ eyes, and you’ll understand where they are coming from.”</p> <p>emsphotoadventures.com<br/>essdras.com</p> <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>About the Silver Spring Camera Club:</p> <p>We meet the first three Thursdays of every month, September – May, and one day on a weekend for a field trip to an interesting photogenic location in the area.</p> <p>More information about the Silver Spring Camera Club can be found on our website (<a href=""http://www.ssccphotography.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ssccphotography.org/</a>) regarding speakers, competitions, field trips, our monthly ""A Closer Focus"" forums, and a link to our award winning newsletter the ""Cable Release"".</p> <p>Visitors to the Club are always welcome to attend meetings, and we hope to see you soon!</p> <p>Membership is $45 for individual members, $65 for family and only $35 for students.</p> <p>Why become a member of the Silver Spring Camera Club?<br/>We are a diverse group of photographers who love field trips, competitions, opportunities to see the world captured by other people's viewpoints, and sharing our knowledge, experience and love of photography.</p> <p>Membership in the club gives you the opportunity to enter your photos in our monthly competitions, to receive our award-winning monthly newsletter the Cable Release, join our field trips without paying the $10 non-member fee, and more!</p> <p>Here's a link to our printable Membership Application. <a href=""http://www.ssccphotography.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Membership-Application-2017-18.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ssccphotography.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Membership-Application-2017-18.pdf</a></p> <p>Visit us on the web: <a href=""http://www.ssccphotography.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.ssccphotography.org/</a></p>",

Plans have (finally) been solidified for this trip!</p> <p>While there are many, many campsites scattered throughout the gorge, most of them are too small to accommodate such a large group. Given the size of the group (10 +/-), I thought it would be best to setup a basecamp for the weekend. Given that, we will camp at Hanson's Point both nights. I am planning a group day hike in the morning on Saturday and a really cool adventure before dinner on Saturday evening as well, both of which are optional. You are also welcome to do your own thing on Saturday if you would prefer. Be as adventurous as you so desire, and be sure to share your plans in case someone else wants to join you!</p> <p>The primary objective here is to get outside with like minded people. To have fun... To take in the views... And to have fun... (Did I mention that already?) ;)</p> <p>With that, if you are arriving on Friday, plan to meet at the trailhead by 12:30 PM so we can break trail by 1 PM. My cellphone # is[masked], so if you are running behind schedule, please notify me ASAP.</p> <p>Here's a link to the exact hike and trailhead we are meeting at to start the adventure, and below that are the trip details:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/kentucky/pinch-em-tight-to-hansons-point?ref=sidebar-static-map"" class=""linkified"">https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/kentucky/pinch-em-tight-to-hansons-point?ref=sidebar-static-map</a></p> <p>Friday, 5/3/19 (Day 1):<br/>Meet at the trailhead at 12:30 PM. The trailhead is the first one on the left once you turn onto Tunnel Ridge Rd. going north. The plan is to follow this exact route to Hanson's Point (link to map &amp; description above), which is one of the best view points in the Gorge. I was just up there last weekend with Hammock Forums and it was amazing! The hike in is only 2.6 miles with minimal elevation gain/loss. For those of you that are looking for a more adventurous option for the hike in, read on:</p> <p>Alternate Option: Instead of starting with the group, we can drop you off at pretty much any other trailhead in the gorge. You'll need to do your homework prior, but if you pick out a starting point and route, we can get you to whatever trailhead you want and you can meet us out at Hanson's Point later in the day on Friday! Be sure to contact me IN ADVANCE to work out those details.</p> <p>Saturday, 5/4/19 (Day 2):<br/>On Saturday morning at around 10 AM, let's plan to take a group lollypop hike to check out Gray's Arch. I estimate that will be about 5.5 miles and 1,000 feet of elevation gain &amp; loss. I'd like to plan on having lunch at Gray's Arch, which is about the 1/2 way point of the hike. We'll need to haul in water containers so we can re-supply on the way back up to Hanson's Point.</p> <p>For those of you meeting us on Saturday, please plan to meet us out at Hanson's Point. I believe we will be back to our campsite by 2 PM +/-. As you hike towards the point, you will walk right through 2-3 campsites. I'm going to setup a sign or landmark or something (details TBD) so that if you arrive before we return, you will know it's our campsite.</p> <p>Later Saturday evening, I'm planning a little bit of an adventure... There's an unofficial trail (I believe it's called ""Pinchem' Tight"") that leads out from the campsite to a different point. It goes down a ways and likely requires some scrambling. I'm not sure if you can get all the way to the forest floor or not, but I'd certainly like to find out. I shot some aerial footage of that exact spot last weekend. Check out the following points on the video below (15:46 - 16:00, then 16:43 - 16:51):</p> <p><a href=""https://youtu.be/GmiwYxjxP6U"" class=""embedded"">https://youtu.be/GmiwYxjxP6U</a></p> <p>Again, if you want to do your own thing on Saturday to knock out more miles, be my guest! If you want to hang out around camp and take in the views, have at it. It's all about having a good time and being safe!</p> <p>Sunday, 5/5/19 (Day 3):<br/>On Sunday, I'm planning to break camp by about 8 AM and hit the trail by 9AM. It's only an hour hike back to the trailhead.</p> <p>I have room for up to 2 more people coming from Indy. Let me know if you need a lift!</p> <p>Cheers!<br/>Garrett</p>",

It lies across the transition from the panhandle plains to the Llano Estacado. As the land falls away, dramatic red sandstone cliffs are formed under a harder sandstone caprock.</p> <p>Thanks to its remote location, Caprock Canyon is one of the best-undiscovered places for night sky photography. The air quality is generally excellent and light pollution is minimal. During the day, numerous hikes into the canyons and on to the top of the ridges offer great views and numerous photographic opportunities. Wildlife is plentiful including prairie dogs, porcupines, birds of prey, roadrunners, deer, coyotes, bobcats and other native creatures as well as the Texas state bison herd. The region also exhibits dramatic spring skies with occasional thunderstorms.</p> <p>The Workshop<br/>This is a laid back workshop. We will hike and make photos, and Andrew will be available to answer questions or to provide 1:1 help. Andrew will lead group hikes each day and lead a night photography session each night. Some of the hikes will be easy and other strenuous.</p> <p>Attendees will have the opportunity to photograph bison and prairie dogs at their leisure. There are ample landscape photo opportunities for those who wish to take advantage of them.</p> <p>There will be a group campfire each evening (burn ban allowing) for everyone to enjoy while sharing their photos and stories from the day (and night).</p> <p>We will send a detailed itinerary to registrants as the event approaches.</p> <p>Camping<br/>We have reserved a block of campsites and your campsite is included in your registration cost. Once you sign up for the class, we will contact you to determine if you need your own site or are sharing it with another attendee.</p> <p>Students are responsible for their own admission to the state park. Admission is $4/person/day ($12 total for the three days of the campout) or free with a current valid state park pass. Cash is required if you arrive after the office closes at 5 p.m.</p> <p>All sites are suitable for RVs up to 40-feet long with 30 amp hookups and water. Pets ARE allowed in the campground as well if you want to bring your favorite 4 legged photo friends! If you have specific RV site needs, please email Andrew ([masked]) to verify what you need. He can set aside a specific site for you on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p> <p>Getting There and Around<br/>Participants are responsible for their own transportation to, from and around the park. Caprock is not a huge park, but we will be driving to trailheads. Participants are welcome to carpool for convenience.</p> <p>Caprock Canyon is located near Quitaque, Texas. It is approximately a 6.5 hours drive from Austin. Limited groceries, “restaurants” and gas are available just outside the park in Quitaque and Turkey. Be aware that the park and Quitaque are in a very rural/farming area without fast food or other 24-hour retailers we take for granted near Austin.</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Andrew is a self-taught photographer who comes from a software engineering background. On his very first trip with a camera, he discovered night photography, and like many photographers he has always been drawn to the beauty of the outdoors. He developed his landscape and night photography skills through trial and error in various environments from the sprawling stark beauty of west Texas to bright urban settings around Washington DC and Austin. When not making landscape, nature and nighttime images, Andrew is shooting for AzulOx Visuals making a variety of images from weddings, to architecture and everything in between. Andrew loves solving problems but more than that, he loves sharing his knowledge with others, helping them grow.</p> <p>You can contact Andrew with questions about the class at [masked]</p>",

Thinking in a creative way and learning how to see photos is what makes some photos better than others. Professional photographer Loren Fisher will show you how to go beyond your normal images and create special shots.</p> <p>This workshop is built on getting feedback on what you shoot and also on your approach to situations. We’ll catch the early morning light each day, shoot the beauty that is Cape May and spend time in the “classroom” talking about creative approaches to photography and reviewing the photos we are shooting. You will get lots of feedback while you are shooting from Loren and also learn from other photographers in the group during our review sessions.</p> <p>Loren will give you challenges each day to get you thinking a little differently about your photographic approach. The challenges are simple but will stretch your mind as you shoot the beauty of Cape May.</p> <p>New Jersey resident Loren Fisher has spent countless hours photographing the Cape May region and will guide you to great locations for a variety of photographic opportunities. Cape May in the spring is a wildlife wonderland. Located at the tip of the New Jersey peninsula, it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay and has been a top tourist destination for over a century.</p> <p>The little town of Cape May is filled with Victorian houses and great beaches. We will spend sunrises and sunsets on the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay photographing horseshoe crabs, birds, the scenic lighthouse and a historic sunken concrete ship. From our beachfront hotel we will explore the ornate Victorian houses and scenic boardwalk of quaint Cape May.</p> <p>Some walking through sand is required to get to the prime locations, but nothing more than 1/4 mile unless you like to wander. There are several nesting areas for birds, turtles and crabs that we will need to be careful not to disturb, no photo is worth damaging a nesting area.</p> <p>We will be getting close to nature and wildlife, but you may want at least a 300mm lens. Longer may be better, you can't have a long enough lens! Many of the beach scenes, boardwalks and town scenes don't require extreme lenses and a wide angle is good to have. We will be getting out early and it can still be chilly, so dress in layers. We won't ever be far from our vehicles, so we can shed clothing as the day warms. May is a fairly dry time in Cape May, but you never know, be prepared for rain. We will be walking though sandy beaches, grassy fields and wet areas. Either go with boots to stay dry or sandals and shed the water. I don't recommend sneakers that would retain moisture.</p> <p>We will be based at a lovely hotel on the beach in Cape May. Transportation while you are at the workshop will be provided in Loren's 12 passenger Mercedes Sprinter van.</p> <p>Friday, May 3 through Sunday, May 5</p> <p>$389 - Regular Registration<br/>$349 - Early Registration by March 1<br/>$329 Previous clients and Premium Members</p> <p>Includes workshop fee, transportation while at the workshop, Saturday pizza lunch and lots of creative fun.</p> <p>Limit: 11 photographers</p> <p>Our tentative itinerary (subject to change)<br/>Friday<br/>Meet at 2 p.m.<br/>2 p.m. Introductory classroom session<br/>4 p.m. First shooting session in town<br/>Cape May beach sunset</p> <p>Saturday<br/>6 a.m. Bay beaches sunrise<br/>11 a.m. Back at hotel<br/>Noon Pizza lunch<br/>1-3 p.m. Classroom<br/>3 p.m. Nature Conservancy<br/>5:00 Lighthouse<br/>We’ll swing past a deli and get food for sunset picnic on the beach<br/>7:15 Sunset beach</p> <p>Sunday<br/>6 a.m. Cape may beach sunrise<br/>10 a.m Final classroom session<br/>Noon done</p> <p>For more info and to register: <a href=""https://lorenphotos.com/mevents/cape-may-photographic-creativity-workshop/"" class=""linkified"">https://lorenphotos.com/mevents/cape-may-photographic-creativity-workshop/</a></p>",

Orozco is a Mexican photographer based in Chihuahua, Mexico and Los Angeles. Born in 1991 in Montebello California, he was raised in the small village of Santa Barbara De Tutuaca in Chihuahua, he began taking photos without instruction, then received his BFA from Calarts in 2016.</p> <p>Orozco has photographed the Tarahumaras of Chihuahua, who populate remote mountain villages in northwestern Mexico for seven years. He first met and befriended some Tarahumaras while working on a farm in Chihuahua. A Tarahumara man named Cornelio noticed his passion for photography and invited him to observe and document a ceremony in his hometown. Joel has returned to the same villages many times, bringing photo prints of his work as gifts.</p> <p>“Encountering a world unlike mine, which time has not altered, and spending seven years amongst the Tarahumaras, I consider myself very lucky. One of my biggest accomplishments in my years of documenting is that I have earned the Tarahumara's trust and respect.”</p> <p>Orozco considers his job as a photographer is to synthesize, to create an intense and poetic work from daily life. However, he believes that the central principle of photography comes from the unconscious state of mind. “The unconscious decision of creating a photograph comes when the photographer decides to press the shutter release, and a fraction of a second becomes another moment in time, a moment you are not consciously aware of because it is not the naked eye recording the moment; it is the eye of the camera, the lens, that is recording. For that second when the eye and mind are blinded because of the shutter release performing its magic, metaphorically speaking, that is the subconscious at work, when the camera registers the discrete moment when the world sends a message that is of great interest to the photographer.”</p> <p>For the past two and a half years, Orozco has also been working on a project that involves the collaboration of the Tarahumaras wearing different masks. Rooted in the tradition of magic realism Orozco combines the mixture of Mexican folk tales to create a theater-like representation where mystifying stories composed of strangeness align with an invented reality that his mind perceives of cultural dreams, religious ceremonies, and personal fantasies. He believes that photography can be about creating fantasy, and is not only about seeing with your eyes, but is also about using the imagination. “The camera can grant us the power to open secret passageways to a whole entirely different world that only exists in our own reality. Although photography is commonly associated with fact, its parallel power has been a medium for fiction from the very beginning of its invention. As an artist, I am still learning the fundamental value of the camera: and how it can show us the world around us.”</p> <p>Foto Forum Santa Fe is a 501-C-3<br/>non-profit that creates an artistic space to explore the current relationship between photography, storytelling, science, and technology through artist exhibitions, workshops, visiting artist lectures, research, and community outreach.</p>",

It is, after all, the speed at which humans evolved to take in the world. By taking a long, slow stroll, listening and talking, we may be able to absorb more and form deeper connections. I think that better equips us to care for one another and our city more thoughtfully.

Santa Fe in the dynamic Railyard Arts District on May 3, 2019 with an art opening, and launch party, from 5 to 8 pm, and an exhibition by photographer Joel Orozco, and screenings of films by Judy Fiskin, video work by Joyce Neimanas, and other contemporary artists at 7:30 pm.</p> <p>The non-profit arts space is now at 1714 Paseo de Peralta, and received its 501-C-3 status in 2018. Executive Director Sage Paisner opened Foto Forum Santa Fe to focus on the current relationship between photography, storytelling, science, and technology. Foto Forum Santa Fe involves the community through exhibitions, workshops, artist lectures, research, presentations by renowned visiting artists, and outreach to students and the community. The gallery/photo studio/darkroom is equipped with an extensive array of cameras and processing equipment to make alternative processes, like platinum palladium, wet plate, cyanotype, and others, as well as traditional black &amp; white gelatin silver, and digital prints.</p> <p>Foto Forum Santa Fe is committed to educate and provide opportunities for photographers and students to experience various forms of analog and digital photography, both historical and contemporary. In January 2019, it held a two-week workshop with students at The New Mexico School for the Arts where they learned how to make digital negatives and print them in the cyanotype process.</p> <p>For 2019, Foto Forum Santa Fe has planned another exciting season of exhibitions and alternative film screenings, featuring international acclaimed photographers, local New Mexican visual story tellers, and young artists. It will also do panel discussions, critiques, photo contests, workshops, and portfolio reviews.</p> <p>The grand re-opening exhibit continues Paisner’s vision to host a space where photographers can meet and work together to exchange ideas, processes, and visual story telling. Sage says, “My dream is to create a place in Santa Fe that is a center for new and exciting photography, and discourse about photo arts. New Mexico has long drawn exceptional photographers, and has a vibrant, influential history of photography. Foto Forum Santa Fe is a new home to celebrate and expand photography in the 21st century that is alternative, community centered, and internationally connected.”</p> <p>Web site: fotoforumsantafe.com sagepaisner.com</p> <p>Contact: Sage Paisner</p> <p>email: [masked]</p> <p>Address: 1714 Paseo De Peralta Santa Fe, NM 87501 Phone:[masked]</p> <p>Foto Forum Santa Fe is a 501-C-3<br/>non-profit that creates an artistic space to explore the current relationship between photography, storytelling, science, and technology through artist exhibitions, workshops, visiting artist lectures, research, and community outreach.<br/>Workshop Information<br/>Artist Talks at Foto Forum<br/>Dark Room &amp; Digital Services<br/>Membership &amp; Donation Information</p>",

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:15 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

He sets up Google Earth in 3D format and then can zoom down on the 3D landscape from any angle and superimpose the Milky Way over the landscape at any time. You can do your scouting from your computer and see what the scene looks like with the Milky Way at the appropriate time.”</p> <p>Endorsement by Royce Bair: ""Gaia GPS has really changed how I find my way in and out of remote locations! I cannot think of being without it in my outdoor photography. Being able to have detailed map layers while I'm at a location, without the need for a cellphone signal, is priceless.""</p>",

Bei uns hilft jeder jedem. Alle Sprachniveaus und Altersgruppen sind willkommen.</p> <p>Deutsch-Anfänger sind oft eingeschüchtert, wenn andere Teilnehmer deutlich besser sprechen. Um Ihnen mehr Zeit zum Finden der Worte zu geben, haben wir deshalb seit Juli <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Survival-German-for-Beginners-Berlin/"">""Survival German for Beginners""</a> gestartet. Die Sitzungen finden meist vormittags, mehrmals in der Woche statt.</p> <p>2. Wir arbeiten u.a. nach der Methode ""LdL"". ""Lernen durch Lehren"" wurde von Jean-Pol Martin für den Französisch-Sprachunterricht entwickelt. Hierbei tritt der Lerner in den Vordergrund. Alle Teilnehmer sind aktiv und übernehmen je nach Niveau verschiedene Rollen. Der Lehrer tritt in den Hintergrund und fungiert eher als Coach statt als traditioneller Wissensvermittler.

Die 3er und 6er-Karten sind 6 Monate gültig! Wir glauben, das ist ein fairer Preis.</p> <p>Darüber hinaus lebt das Café ""Kauf dich glücklich"" natürlich vom Verkauf der Getränke.

Defiant Empathy is a summary of Teri’s journey through Photography into the inside world of strip clubs, drag bars and burlesque venues that travelled the world.</p> <p>Teri Darnell is an artist passionate about people being able to live with who they are inside. She uses her camera to connect to places few people explore. Casual encounters drive her inspiration to express an inward sensitivity to the lives of others. That sensitivity is evident in her images which enable viewers to engage in worlds that stretch their imagination.</p> <p>Teri serves as Vice-Chair of the Advisory Council for Atlanta Celebrates Photography. She served six years in the United States Air Force, notably in Berlin during the Cold War. In 2015, she retired after twenty-five years of service with a Fortune 50 company as a Multi-Media Development Manager to pursue her passion in photography.</p> <p>You can find more about Teri and her work at <a href=""http://www.teridarnell.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.teridarnell.com/</a></p> <p>******************************************************************************</p> <p>SPS Monthly Meetings (first Friday of each month) are for its members and guests.

Variety: We feature a wide variety of models with alll body shapes and sizes, races and of course both male and female models which allow our participants to have lot more chances to draw something interesting each time.</p> <p>2. Creativity: We don't stick to the classical format of most nude croquis sessions in Korea. While we do have basic nude drawing and gesture drawing sessions, we also like to mix things up at least once a month with special costumed or themed drawing sessions. Everything from fetish and crime scene nights to ethnic and traditional clothing from around the world. We even have drawing nights with performance artists or poets and musicians standing in as our drawing subjects.</p> <p>3. Atmosphere: From the warm studio lighting (which makes everybody look nice) to the music and overall vibe, we know our studio is special and people come back for the sense of community and the welcoming atmosphere that we embrace. No stuffy, silent studio or talk radio for us. We like to groove while we draw:)<br/>Plus there's you're welcome to bring your own wine or beer if you need a little something to loosen up while drawing.</p> <p>4. No perv policy: A mature, adult environment can only be had when everyone follows the rules. We try to quickly identify and dismiss anyone not mature enough or suitable for the life drawing experience.</p> <p>Our Sessions</p> <p>1.<br/>Fridays: 7:30-9:30pm long pose session. This is great for those wishing to take their time and get a more finished image produced. You can also move around and work on several short drawings during this log pose session.</p> <p>2.<br/>Saturdays: 6:00-8:00pm short pose session. 3,5,10 &amp; 20 minute poses for practice and gesture drawing work. <br/>3. bonus sunday mornings (only once a month for now) 10am-1pm (check website)</p> <p>토요일 오후 6-8시: 누드 크로키<br/>금요일 오후 7:30-9:30:고정포즈 누드 드로잉</p> <p>These classes are good for all levels. Tips and basic instruction can be provided for anyone in need, but this is mostly an open session for people to practice drawing and painting from the live model.</p> <p>Most sessions are nude, but we also have special costumed (themed) drawing sessions which are a lot of fun.</p> <p>Walk-ins are always welcome. No drawing experience is required to come give life drawing a try.</p> <p>10,000won for one night or buy a ""5 Sessions Card"" for 40,000won which can be used for any life drawing session.<br/>1회 참가비 10,000원 (5회 참가비 40,000원)</p> <p>We also have a variety of sketch books for sale as well as drawing supplies free to use in the studio.</p> <p>*sessions with nude models are for adults only.</p> <p>Directions from Itaewon Station.<br/>Come out exit 3 and make a U-turn.

With a little bit of luck you will go home with amazing photos and a few new friends!</p> <p>We ask that you arrive on time as the group will most likely depart no later than 15 minutes after the scheduled time. If you missed the departure time then please check the comments below to see where the group went. We also ask that you be a little flexible regarding location decision as it may be a spot that you have recently visited. This event is all about getting up early and hanging out with a few other happy photographers while capturing an epic sunrise. We will not be disappointed if you choose to go elsewhere after the location has been decided.</p> <p>A few recommendations: Wear slippers but bring your shoes and leave them in the car if not needed. Consider wearing shorts that can get wet. There is a chance you could be walking in water up to your hips so use a backpack to carry all your items. Bring a headlamp or a flashlight as it will be dark while walking and setting up. Keep a rain jacket and an umbrella in your car. Bring a sturdy tripod and a remote shutter if available. A remote shutter will allow you to capture long exposures well over 30 seconds. Charge your batteries and empty your memory cards the night prior, but don't forget them in the morning! Always smile because it's going to be a great day!</p> <p>Any questions please post in the comments.</p> <p>Liability Waiver: The Oahu Photography Group and Hawaii Photography Tours assumes no responsibility, liability, and/or fees for injury, damage, loss, accident, defects, or irregularity to cameras, equipment, vehicles, persons, and/or other related categories whatsoever.

This is purely a fun event. With a list of clues, you’ll shoot photos during the day to share with the group at a party in the evening. This event will go on, rain or shine.<br/>Note that we’ll have a potluck at the party, so bring some food to share (let us know what that will be in the comments below so we don’t end up with all desserts).<br/>Here’s the short description:<br/>Part 1<br/>When: Clues are posted at 7:30 AM on Saturday, May 4; you shoot throughout the day ending at 5:00 pm.<br/>Where: Anywhere (Shoot wherever you are—doesn’t have to be in York County).<br/>Please shoot in JPG only—see why below.<br/>Part 2<br/>When you’re finished shooting, select ONE image to submit for each clue, renaming and copying it to a memory card to bring to the party so we can all see your interpretation. (Doing this correctly is extremely important! See below for details on how to do this.)<br/>Part 3<br/>When: 6:00 PM May 4, 2018<br/>Where: George Kurzik’s house (address and directions will be sent a few days before the event to those who RSVP “Yes.”)<br/>Here are the details:<br/>Part 1<br/>For a normal scavenger hunt, you find and retrieve things from a list. For a photo scavenger hunt, you take away only images of the things on the list. Plus clues don’t have to involve physical items; there might be emotions, gestures, suggestions, hints, fantasies, and events.<br/>At 7:30 AM, on the day of the Photo Scavenger Hunt, we’ll send a list of the clues to capture via email to those who RSVP Yes. We’ll also post a jpg image of the list just above the Comments on this event's web-page (also in the 2019 Scavenger Hunt album on the Photos page). You’ll have until 5:00 PM to shoot photos of as many clues as you can, anywhere you want. Your creativity is tested and exercised to the limit in this event. Kudos are gained by providing the most innovative solution to the clue.<br/>Here’s an example: For a clue of “Dinosaur,” you might shoot a child’s toy or a 1960’s gas-guzzling Cadillac. Clues are open to your interpretation.<br/>Part 2<br/>When you’re finished shooting your clues, download your images to your computer and go through them to find the one image for each clue that you’d like to share with the group. You won’t have time to enhance what you’ve taken, which is the reason to shoot in jpg. Rename each chosen image with the number of the clue and your initials. (Important!)<br/>Example: For clue #3, if your name is Ann Good, you’d rename that image “3ag.jpg.”<br/>On a memory card or USB thumb drive, create a directory (folder) &amp; name it something relevant. Copy all of your chosen images into that folder on the memory card (or USB thumb drive) and bring that to the meeting at George’s house.<br/>Part 3<br/>We’ll meet at George Kurzik’s house at 6 PM to share our results. When you arrive, you’ll hand over your memory device so Lynn can copy your images onto a computer so we can share all of our images on George’s TV while having refreshments (that we've each brought along).<br/>There are no prizes, just the adulation of the crowd. We hope to see you there!</p>",

If you don't have a surfboard, check the link above and coordinate with someone from the NJ Surfing Group!</p> <p>If you want to buy your own board before you show up, COSTCO has a feature packed board that is not alot of money ($159). You can get it here, and the cost includes shipping to your house... <a href=""https://www.costco.com/Wavestorm-8'-Surfboard-BlueGreen-Pinline.product.100471896.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.costco.com/Wavestorm-8'-Surfboard-BlueGreen-Pinline.product.100471896.html</a><br/>Check it out!</p> <p>Also, if you want to rent a board, the Inlet/Outlet surf shop in Manasquan does rent boards. If enough people are interested, you might even be able to get them to deliver to the beach. So check them out too!</p> <p>This year has been pretty warm. So I'm figuring the season opener may happen sooner in May than usual.<br/>So I'm going to shoot for the First weekend in May, 3 weeks before memorial day. No paying for parking, no paying for beach passes! The pre-season is great in that way... Also Bradley has the facilities, bathrooms, showers, and places to eat! I guess since this is my first trip as an organizer for this group, I'm going say we meet at 3rd Ave and Ocean Ave, in Bradley beach, under the flags, then figure out where the best waves are from there! Obviously, I'd like to get to know everyone, and I don't mind leading. Figure you should probably bring your spring wetsuit, the water temps should average between 50 and 60 degrees at this time of year! If you don't have a wetsuit, bring along a water shirt, it should be enough.<br/>I'm not limiting the size of the group, and I'm not limiting based on ability either! Bring some food and drink to share, we could kind of pot luck this thingy! Lets also plan on having dinner somewhere nearby at the end of the day! The waves are kinda small this time of year... So I'm going to bring my big foamie... If I'm wrong...great! If NOTHING is going on, and there's flat-water, we'll do some kind of beach or boardwalk walk... Looking forward to seeing you all there! Bring extra boards for any newbies who want to join us... Please put a note on the meetup if you can bring an extra board and don't mind someone else using it! The more the merrier! So see all you grommets and shredders at the event!</p>",

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken.

After that frigid February and early March it is time for us to get out on some photo excursions.</p> <p>So how would you like to spend time with a Wolfpack, where the wolves are all actors and actresses and have been in films, Game of Thrones, etc. You can get close up and personal and have some incredible photo ops. The link below will take you to the webpage ""instinctforfilm.com"" where you can see some photographs of the wolves, the environment where they live to the north of Calgary etc.<br/>We will be introduced to as many as 40 wolves, be able to stroke some and have them sit with us while being guided through the facility by our very capable guide.</p> <p>This is not a free event. Although there is no official entry the facility does require $50 per person to help feed the wolves and keep them healthy.</p> <p>Please let me know if you are interested so that I can firm up some dates. We will have to accept being flexible as we have to work around their production schedule.<br/>Here is the link to<br/><a href=""http://instinctforfilm.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://instinctforfilm.com/</a></p> <p>I will be detailing some other trips once I get a response to this opportunity and fix a date.

Its not too advanced but will showcase some incredible wildlife and landscapes for photo opportunities.</p> <p>We are going to get out and explore the back country wilderness and natural wonders of the West Kettle River in Carmi, BC. Our hired guide Pete will lead us off the beaten trail to some of the most picturesque locations in the area. He is an experienced hiker, and has lead many people to wonderful locations in his life. Pete is extremely knowledgeable of the area, the trees, birds, animals and the like. We can walk the trails, or do river walking - or maybe a bit of both! We'll come across wildlife in all states and YES there may be bones &amp; skeletons. A little ghoulish - but also very interesting to shoot! Whatever we do we are sure you will leave feeling uplifted, refreshed and ready to come back again!</p> <p>Getting to Carmi is not only easy it's a scenic drive - plan to stop and snap a pic or two along the way. It is 78 km (51 mi) from Kelowna on Hwy. 33. Head East up past Big White - it's about another 30 minutes once you've passed Big White. Turn left on to Smoker Road which is just after the second bridge (once you've seen the entering Beaverdell sign).</p> <p>Please plan to arrive by 7:45am at the end of Smoker Road. Park in the cul-de-sac where our guide Pete will meet us. MUST HAVE appropriate hiking gear! Footwear is important and a good all season jacket should be worn. Layers folks! It can be quite chilly and the area is known for having the widest daily temperature range - meaning it can get up to 30 during the day but early morning, and sunset will be a chilly 3.</p> <p>After we've hiked and congregated back in the cul-de-sac we can head up to the guide's plateau to relax before heading home. A special bonus: you'll have all day access to the property to explore at your leisure, relax, and take even more photographs! If we have any drone enthusiasts, the plateau is a great place to practice getting those stunning photos! They have fresh filtered Berkey water available for us and we can bring our own refreshments.</p> <p>The group rate is $60+7.80 tax per person for the 4 hour tour and we have 10 spots available. It's usually 3 hours but we are getting an extra hour in to get those shots! Since this hike has limited spots AND we are trying something new, please RSVP asap to show your interest. Fees are due April 27th - we don't require a deposit when you sign up and we'll coordinate payment and ride sharing closer to the event. Please watch for the updates.</p> <p>Please be mindful of yourself, your fellow photo walkers, your property and your surroundings at all times! Kelowna Photo-walks and its organizers are not responsible for you or your property! After the meet-up don't forget to upload up to eight of your best images.</p>",

A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne.</p> <p>Trip Highlights:</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England<br/>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed<br/>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike<br/>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town<br/>• Explore the Seven Sisters National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>Photos - All photos were taken by the hike leader on previous trips so are the actual views that you will see from the route that you'll be hiking.</p> <p>Hike Description</p> <p>There are some iconic views on this hike and we'll get some great fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last ice age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 74 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head from here to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>Transport &amp; Meeting Point</p> <p>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:15am and leave the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:46am train.

Please keep at least 3 metres away from the edges.

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken. Camera stores and camera repair shops routinely charge $50 to $100 for a single cleaning.</p> <p>FCCP will be offering FREE sensor cleanings to FCCP Supporters. Supporters are those members that have paid their annual dues for 2018/19. If you are not yet a FCCP Supporter and would like to pay your dues and get your sensor cleaned, please visit this link.

The $20 can be paid at the door in cash, exact change please.</p> <p>Please sign up for the time slot you’d like to have your sensor cleaned. We are booking cleanings in ½ hour intervals starting at 8 AM and continuing until 11 AM. We are limiting signup to just 15 members per 30 minute period. The cleaning takes just a few minutes and is done on a first come, first served basis for the ½ hour period. One RSVP is required for each camera. No more than 1 RSVP per ½ hour.</p> <p>Cameras must be submitted for a cleaning with the following accessories:</p> <p>1) Lens<br/>2) Fully charged battery<br/>3) Empty storage card (Compact Flash, SD or other)</p> <p>While you wait for your camera you can enjoy beverages at O’keefe’s. They offer coffe, tea, juices and soft drinks. Lunch is available starting at 11 AM.</p> <p>My Recommended Retailers</p> <p>Where you buy your gear matters.

CASA also loves the support of our group and has used many of our members's images to help promote the race and a CASA's role in helping children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. So, grab your camera and come out and get some great images and help support a wonderful cause.</p> <p>I recommend arriving at 9am as it is fun to watch the kids gather and prepare for their race. It is a short 1k race and is over pretty quickly, so you need to be prepared. The adults run a full 5k so there are more opportunities to capture images of them. There are post race activities for the kids which provide wonderful colorful photo opps!

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken. Camera stores and camera repair shops routinely charge $50 to $100 for a single cleaning.</p> <p>FCCP will be offering FREE sensor cleanings to FCCP Supporters. Supporters are those members that have paid their annual dues for 2018/19. If you are not yet a FCCP Supporter and would like to pay your dues and get your sensor cleaned, please visit this link.

We are booking cleanings in ½ hour intervals starting at 8 AM and continuing until 11 AM. We are limiting signup to just 15 members per 30 minute period. The cleaning takes just a few minutes and is done on a first come, first served basis for the ½ hour period. One RSVP is required for each camera.

If you have a smart phone but rarely take photos, or take photos but want to learn more, this is the program for you!<br/>Gold Rush is a Chapter of PSA (Photographic Society of America) that has provided quarterly day-long photography programs in Sacramento for many years. In September, 2018, Gold Rush changed its format to offer photography presentations in the morning and shooting opportunities in the afternoon inspired by the morning presentation.<br/>On Saturday, May 4th, Gold Rush hosts Sean Duggan with a program on Smart Phone Creativity: Photography and Processing. Registration is at 9am, with the presentation in the morning, followed by a no-host lunch at a nearby restaurant, then an opportunity in the afternoon to practice what we learned in the morning--so bring your charged smart phone! Sean Duggan is an experienced Smart Phone photographer, with many workshops and books to his credit, and we're looking forward to a great program and shoot!<br/>The cost is $10 for the presentation and $25 for the presentation and shoot, with no charge for PSA/Gold Rush members. (You can join PSA there or online.) There is no limit on space for the presentation, but space for the shoot will be limited due to logistics, and PSA members will get priority--but at this point it looks as if there will be room for everyone. It's helpful if you sign up for the shoot by emailing [masked], or just come.<br/>You can visit the Gold Rush website at www.psagoldrush.org for more information. Looking forward to seeing you there! Sincerely, Laurie Friedman, VP Programs, PSA Gold Rush<br/>P.S. Our next program is on Saturday, October 5th, with Lewis Kemper presenting Motion Studies, so mark your calendars now!</p>",

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken. Camera stores and camera repair shops routinely charge $50 to $100 for a single cleaning.</p> <p>FCCP will be offering FREE sensor cleanings to FCCP Supporters. Supporters are those members that have paid their annual dues for 2018/19. If you are not yet a FCCP Supporter and would like to pay your dues and get your sensor cleaned, please visit this link.

The $20 can be paid at the door in cash, exact change please.</p> <p>Please sign up for the time slot you’d like to have your sensor cleaned. We are booking cleanings in ½ hour intervals starting at 8 AM and continuing until 11 AM. We are limiting signup to just 15 members per 30 minute period. The cleaning takes just a few minutes and is done on a first come, first served basis for the ½ hour period. One RSVP is required for each camera. No more than 1 RSVP per ½ hour.</p> <p>Cameras must be submitted for a cleaning with the following accessories:</p> <p>1) Lens<br/>2) Fully charged battery<br/>3) Empty storage card (Compact Flash, SD or other)</p> <p>While you wait for your camera you can enjoy beverages at O’keefe’s.

New York architect, John Eberson conceived a design for the Loew's Theatre Corporation influenced by both Moorish and Spanish baroque structures. According to architectural historian Calder Loth, ""Loew's was considered the most up-to-date theater in the South when it opened on April 9, 1928."" Eberson was famous for having invented the ""atmospheric theater"" design in which the theater walls resembled an elegant villa or streetscape under a night sky. The Carpenter Theatre design evokes a Spanish setting with a faux sky ceiling containing stars and moving clouds. The Richmond Performing Alliance has made a special accommodation to allow RPMG to take a photographic tour of the theater. This is a very special opportunity to get some interior shots of this stunning place. There will be two tours. One at 10am and one at 11am. Due to constraints only 20 people on each tour. Bring your tripod! There is no fee for the tour, but a $10 donation is encouraged. web site: <a href=""https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter</a></p>",

The workshop aims to introduce you to street photography.</p> <p>We will be exploring various types of street photography which are popular today. We will also be thinking about how best to use your camera on the street and we will not forget the legal and ethical issues involved in street photography. It's an genre of photography which gives rise to great emotions and we will try and understand this too.</p> <p>The workshop is divided into three sections:</p> <p>AN OVERVIEW OF STREET PHOTOGRAPHY<br/>We will exploring various types of street photography from candid shots (of people in street scenes) and posed street portraits to urban architecture and street details.</p> <p>CAMERA USE ON THE STREET<br/>Street photography is not easy, it is a dynamic mixture of technique and artistic intention. We will look at how to improve and use your understanding of your camera and match that up with the type of images you want to create on the street.</p> <p>LAW AND ETHICS ON THE STREET<br/>You can pretty much photograph anything you like on the street. But, there are some restrictions. Some restrictions are legal and might be used against you, while others are ethical which you chose to apply to yourself. Understanding the law and thinking about ethics can all help to smooth your street photography.</p> <p>After the workshop (from 12:30 - 1:30) you are welcome to join a one hour photowalk around Guildford's High Street area. You will have the opportunity to practice your street photography with help and support. This is a no-charge optional extension to the workshop.</p> <p>There will be ample opportunities to ask questions.</p> <p>The workshop is open to anyone interested in getting involved or improving their street photography.<br/>This workshop is suitable for all types of cameras from smart phones and compacts through to mirrorless and DSLR cameras.</p> <p>About your tutor:<br/>Peter Merry has been teaching photography for a number of years, both to groups and on a one-to-one basis.

Im excited :)</p> <p>This session is scheduled for Saturday, May 4th 10.10am-1.10pm.<br/>It's a 3 hours long shoot with a short break in between.</p> <p>THEME:</p> <p>Natural Light Fine Art photography</p> <p>I'd love for you to feel the atmosphere in the space and capture the environment the way it is at the moment you are shooting.<br/>I don't know if the light will be soft or direct and whether it will be a sunny or rainy day. We'll be working on seeing and capturing whatever the mood the day will bring and I will have enough props and wardrobe to cover different scenarios.</p> <p>Please DO NOT bring any lights or equipment with you, just your camera/lens kit/reflector/tripod.<br/>This is one of the requirements for me to be able to rent the space for a shoot, as well as part of the theme for this shoot. It's challenging and also rewarding to keep thing as natural as possible.</p> <p>I will rent some vintage pieces to style 4-5 looks.<br/>One of the themes we'll do forsure is boho lifestyle photography + a few other themes depending on what I find in Vancouver vintage stores</p> <p>I have pastel pink hair now and the whole wardrobe colour sceme will be around pink, blue, nude, light green colours</p> <p>We can try some partial body-paint as well. I'll bring metallic colours. Since this will be a longer session I would like for everyone to think of their own idea during the shoot. Styling can be different for every participant depending on their vision.</p> <p>All the props, wardrobe and styling will be provided.</p> <p>Shooting time: around 3 hours, 4 participants maximum.</p> <p>My latest modelling/editing work:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artdecomodel/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/artdecomodel/</a><br/><a href=""https://www.modelmayhem.com/katesnig"" class=""linkified"">https://www.modelmayhem.com/katesnig</a></p> <p>FORMAT:</p> <p>If you need to achieve a certain effect or mood in the image, we will be able to discuss your ideas and I will help you achieve the desired result.</p> <p>I can help with art direction, use of light sources, composition, position of the model and angles to create a unique atmosphere in the photographs. But I would love for your to create your own images that will not look like any other in our group shoot.</p> <p>LOCATION:</p> <p><a href=""https://thisopenspace.com/spaces/3930-bright-loft-studio-on-main-st"" class=""linkified"">https://thisopenspace.com/spaces/3930-bright-loft-studio-on-main-st</a></p> <p>Main Intersection: Cambie and W Broadway<br/>I will send the exact address via private message after you sign up.</p> <p>MY CONTACT:</p> <p>Message me on Facebook (search Kate Snig) or call/text at six four seven nine seven five seven two zero one.

You cannot sell the images commercially without obtaining a separate release from the models. A non-commercial photography release will be provided upon request via email.</p> <p>PAYMENT:</p> <p>cash, e-transfer or PayPal before the event; cancellation fee equal to the full amount of the workshop applies if canceled within 10 days before the event.</p> <p>Due to the change in Meetup policies on NUDITY we WILL NOT post any nudes in this group.</p>",

We plan to eat lunch a little after Noon at Oakland's Morcom Rose Garden. If something such as a wedding prevents us from eating there we will eat later at the Piedmont Park.</p> <p>Our SF mansions walk is super popular. Oakland is unjustly famous for nothing but poverty and crime. However Oakland like San Francisco, has wealthy areas as well as poor ones. We will walk in some of the good places in Oakland and Piedmont. Inside Oakland is the town of Piedmont which in the 1920's had more millionaires per square mile than any other place in the USA. Piedmont used to be a city of super rich Republicans and now it is a city of ordinary rich Democrats. Piedmont looks as good as now as then. All of the mansions are still there in all of their old glory with flowers and gardens.</p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/7/0/event_22930352.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/8/5/event_22930629.jpeg"" /></p> <p>There are historic sites that we will see in Oakland such as the former home of former Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and the former home of the once famous entertainer Al Jolson, who was the star of the first talking movie. We end this 7.2 mile walk back at the 19th Street BART Station about 4:30 PM.</p> <p>If you have any questions about how to get around the Bay Area on public transportation below is a trip planner link provided by government: <a href=""http://transit.511.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://transit.511.org/</a></p> <p>I highly recommend taking BART because our starting/ending point is just across the street from 2 BART entrances. If you have to drive you will probably find free street parking in the Adams Point neighborhood, but that is not certain. Do not park in the Whole Foods Market parking lot for more than 2 hours.

Who was this woman? How had her family come to Colorado? What challenges had she faced and overcome to enroll and get a degree from CU? These and dozens of other questions set Polly on a quest that lead to her book, Remembering Lucile: A Virginia Family’s Rise from Slavery and a Legacy Forged a Mile High.</p> <p>If you are an aspiring author or researcher, there is much to gain from Polly’s perspective on the ins-and-outs of a complex research process, the archival opportunities in Colorado and beyond, why face-to-face contacts matter, how to work with acquisition editors, and the challenges you might face in the publishing process. Please join us for this fascinating discussion of a successful investigative research process.</p> <p>Polly E.

The dust blocks light from reaching some of the pixels and creates grey “orbs” in our photos (see sample below).</p> <p>Some cameras have various internal methods of cleaning the dust off the sensor. However, the dust is still in the shutter box and reattaches to the sensor the next time a photo is taken. Camera stores and camera repair shops routinely charge $50 to $100 for a single cleaning.</p> <p>FCCP will be offering FREE sensor cleanings to FCCP Supporters. Supporters are those members that have paid their annual dues for 2018/19. If you are not yet a FCCP Supporter and would like to pay your dues and get your sensor cleaned, please visit this link.

The $20 can be paid at the door in cash, exact change please.</p> <p>Please sign up for the time slot you’d like to have your sensor cleaned. We are booking cleanings in ½ hour intervals starting at 8 AM and continuing until 11 AM. We are limiting signup to just 15 members per 30 minute period. The cleaning takes just a few minutes and is done on a first come, first served basis for the ½ hour period. One RSVP is required for each camera. No more than 1 RSVP per ½ hour.</p> <p>Cameras must be submitted for a cleaning with the following accessories:</p> <p>1) Lens<br/>2) Fully charged battery<br/>3) Empty storage card (Compact Flash, SD or other)</p> <p>While you wait for your camera you can enjoy beverages at O’keefe’s.

Some clues what you heard is wrong: Adobe98 or ProPhoto is the best color (icc) profile: WRONG! sRGB color (icc) profile is the worst: WRONG! Calibrate your monitor and your workflow is color managed: WRONG! Uploading images for the web requires ______ [fill in the blank] (icc) profile: WRONG! High End / Custom print labs require _____ [fill in the blank] (icc) profile: 99.99% WRONG! I can keep going, but lets regress and presume whatever you read / heard is wrong to make the most of this one.</p> <p>Why so much wrong information? Arguably, to understand a color managed workflow requires many hours of credible education and expertise. If the educator is just regurgitating what they read on some blog that doesn't qualify as ""credible education and expertise"". Anything less is a disservice to you and wasting your money, time and effort and probably leading to worse results.</p> <p>I'm going to sum up what you need to do, and not do, in very direct and pointed steps. Just bring notepad and pen.</p> <p>This is NOT a workshop that teaches the ins and outs of each step, this is a ""do as your taught and you'll be good"" presentation. To learn more in-depth the ins and outs and setting it up yourself attend the workshop (posting soon, keep an eye out for it).</p> <p>::AGENDA::</p> <p>* New members are offered to introduce themselves and share little history on their connection to photography.</p> <p>* Gadget show and tell: Anyone, bring photography related gadgets to [briefly] explain and/or pass around. This is pot luck and we do 1-3 items.</p> <p>* Mention note worthy group news or changes.</p> <p>* Members are invited to share recent photography achievements (published, won award, etc).</p> <p>* Members are offered to share upcoming photography related opportunities</p> <p>* Monthly Challenge: (see above for topic)<br/>The Challenge has two divisions: No/Light and Heavy post processing. Members may submit ONE image to each division, it is up to the member to decide which division an image belongs.

Eighteen months later, he opened his studio of photo design in Frankfurt, but racing has always remained a major aspect of his work. Right from the very beginning, initially in monochrome only, he photographed for numerous prestigious motorsport publications and in motor racing involved companies.</p> <p>Since 1974, 5 years already in color, RWS has focused exclusively on Formula 1 championship races. Between the 1990s and today, he has published over 40 works of photography, which have brought him worldwide acclaim. RWS edited books about cars and did more than 500 shootings on location with cars of Ferrari, Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, Aston Martin, and other British Sports Car factories.</p> <p>Changing to digital photography 2004, his archive totals 15,000 monochrome photographs and over 400,000 color slides and digital images. It's worldwide today's biggest, perfect organized motorsport archive out of one hand.</p> <p>In Monza 2011 Bernie Ecclestone honored Rainer with a lifetime permanent photographer's pass.</p> <p>Even after nearly 600 GPs, he’s still driven by the same passion: The never-ending quest for an even better photo.</p>",

New York architect, John Eberson conceived a design for the Loew's Theatre Corporation influenced by both Moorish and Spanish baroque structures. According to architectural historian Calder Loth, ""Loew's was considered the most up-to-date theater in the South when it opened on April 9, 1928."" Eberson was famous for having invented the ""atmospheric theater"" design in which the theater walls resembled an elegant villa or streetscape under a night sky. The Carpenter Theatre design evokes a Spanish setting with a faux sky ceiling containing stars and moving clouds. The Richmond Performing Alliance has made a special accommodation to allow RPMG to take a photographic tour of the theater. This is a very special opportunity to get some interior shots of this stunning place. There will be two tours. One at 10am and one at 11am. Due to constraints only 20 people on each tour. Bring your tripod! There is no fee for the tour, but a $10 donation is encouraged. web site: <a href=""https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dominionenergycenter.com/venues/detail/carpenter</a></p>",

The salt lake in Port Melbourne has turned pink again. Melbourne's pink lake is all natural. The bright pink colour in the salt lake is caused by a natural phenomenon. It only turns pink when salt levels are higher than usual. There are also a few other ingredients needed to turn the lake pink: high temperatures, lots of sunlight and a lack of rainfall. The lake started to turn pink last week, and it's expected to stay pink for a few days.</p> <p>Please use the toilets in Melbourne Central if you need them as the lake does not have any operational toilets.</p> <p>This is a Free Event!</p> <p>Important: Please note that we don’t allow carpooling for safety reasons.

So it will take 2-3 hours to see &amp; explore everything.This forest would be great for a 5th sequel to a King Kong movie. Very prehistoric, lush, creeks, etc. &amp; wild , with trees that reach the clouds. (Forget Muir woods) There are no people here. *** On our April trip, one member was shedding a few tears &amp; when asked why; she said it was just so beautiful. While 2 others said they had life altering experiences in this forest.<br/>After we depart from the forest we can meet for dinner in Ukiah.</p> <p>NOTE: Vichy Springs claims to be the only 30,000 ft. deep carbonated warm water springs in North America. It was used for it's therapy /carbonated waters to soothe the body &amp; soul. Famous authors , artists and presidents have come here like Robert Louis Stevenson &amp; Jack London,&amp; Teddy Roosevelt. The water tastes like a sweet champagne /minus the alcohol. We will have inside &amp; outside tubs to soak in. There are other soaking &amp; jacuzzi like pools to relax in. There is also a large olympic pool ; plus a spa , salon &amp; massage treatments available.<br/>**We will start the beautiful waterfall &amp; creek hike &amp; optional cave hike.<br/>this is a 2-3 mile R.T. (Including additional cave option) Last time we had to be careful as it was mating season for all the colorful Newts that were in the creek or on the trails.<br/>This is one short but cool trek. There are some really huge &amp; old vines in the trees that can be climbed or to swing on. The falls are beautiful with a 30 ft. pool below. The pool is about 6- 7 ft. deep. When you arrive; you will think of a hidden paradise.<br/>After returning to the Resort; we will have our wine picnic under the trees in their beautiful grounds. After lunch we can take our turns in the pools &amp; tubs. We can stay till 6 pm. but you may leave when you wish.<br/>** What to bring: bathing suit &amp; towels, good hiking shoes or tough hiking sandals, Xtra shoes &amp; a jacket. Hiking gear as usual. A fanny pack or small backpack.<br/>The cost: $99.</p> <p>I'll have the usual snacks &amp; other food &amp; drinks &amp; wine, hiking poles, etc.<br/>**Pay via P.Pal.

We will work using soft natural window light at this class. Each workshop participant will be able to select from a variety of individual flowers (living), succulents (living), and feathers (artificial) to enhance their composition and lighting practice to feature a single item. No wind, no harsh sunlight.</p> <p>When photographing a still life subject, you have the opportunity to create an image rather than capturing a moment. Your photography is constructed from the background, to the subject, to the lighting. Since the subjects are inanimate objects, you can take your time to refine your exposure and light, as well as experiment with compositions. It’s a very pleasant way to enjoy your photography, and you don’t need any fancy gear.</p> <p>I want to encourage you to slow and take the time to make &amp; create a photograph when you can incorporate your own responses and style, with gently aided composition and camera setting suggestions.</p> <p>Photography techniques covered will include close up photography, balancing composition, selective focus, choosing backgrounds for simplicity and mood, the importance of point of view, B&amp;W, and more.</p> <p>Tripods will enable sharper images and these can be borrowed if you don’t have one. If you have macro capability this is ideal, but a longer zoom (up to 300mm) will give close-up shots. If you're new and just starting out, don't worry....you will learn how to use your current equipment creatively.</p> <p>This workshop is suitable for beginners and new group members.<br/>Library opens right at noon, so we will start about 12:15.</p> <p>Date: Saturday May 4, 2019<br/>Time: 12:00 - 2:30pm<br/>Fee: $25</p> <p>Location Howe Branch Library<br/>105 Schuyler Street<br/>Albany NY 12202<br/>There is off street parking.</p>",

We'll have a BYO snack stop at some point, so bring a snack (or late lunch), water and sun and rain protection and sturdy shoes for some slippery tracks. There are lots of hills and steps so a good level of fitness is required to maintain a medium to fast pace. Those who wish to could get a coffee at 1929 expresso bar after the walk (which is inside the museum). The cafe seating closes at 4 but you can apparently get takeaway coffees up to 430 so that might be an option or go elsewhere.</p> <p>Good idea to allow extra time to park your car. Some buses go right to the Domain :)</p> <p>Toilets: Please note...The atruim and atruim cafe and toilets are currently not open to the public. We are meeting at the north facing entrance. I visited the Museum today and you are permitted to use the clean flash toilets and cafe without paying an entrance fee.<br/>We can also pass a toilet en route and the winter gardens toilet.</p> <p>Please note, I've allowed for 30 people on this walk...which is more than the normal 25. If no longer able to attend please remove your name from the list to make place for someone else to attend.<br/>If you're on the wait list, kindly wait your turn. We would like to take everyone who wants to come, but we also want to keep the group smallish..25 or less, so please understand if you don't make it into the ""Yes"" list prior to the event.</p>",

Im excited :)</p> <p>This session is scheduled for Saturday, May 4th[masked]pm.<br/>It's a 3 hours long shoot with a short break in between.</p> <p>THEME:</p> <p>Natural Light Fine Art photography</p> <p>I'd love for you to feel the atmosphere in the space and capture the environment the way it is at the moment you are shooting.<br/>I don't know if the light will be soft or direct and whether it will be a sunny or rainy day. We'll be working on seeing and capturing whatever the mood the day will bring and I will have enough props and wardrobe to cover different scenarios.</p> <p>Please DO NOT bring any lights or equipment with you, just your camera/lens kit/reflector/tripod.<br/>This is one of the requirements for me to be able to rent the space for a shoot, as well as part of the theme for this shoot. It's challenging and also rewarding to keep thing as natural as possible.</p> <p>I will rent some vintage pieces to style 4-5 looks.<br/>One of the themes we'll do forsure is boho lifestyle photography + a few other themes depending on what I find in Vancouver vintage stores</p> <p>I have pastel pink hair now and the whole wardrobe colour sceme will be around pink, blue, nude, light green colours</p> <p>We can try some partial body-paint as well. I'll bring metallic colours. Since this will be a longer session I would like for everyone to think of their own idea during the shoot. Styling can be different for every participant depending on their vision.</p> <p>All the props, wardrobe and styling will be provided.</p> <p>Shooting time: around 3 hours, 4 participants maximum.</p> <p>My latest modelling/editing work:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artdecomodel/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/artdecomodel/</a><br/><a href=""https://www.modelmayhem.com/katesnig"" class=""linkified"">https://www.modelmayhem.com/katesnig</a></p> <p>FORMAT:</p> <p>If you need to achieve a certain effect or mood in the image, we will be able to discuss your ideas and I will help you achieve the desired result.</p> <p>I can help with art direction, use of light sources, composition, position of the model and angles to create a unique atmosphere in the photographs. But I would love for your to create your own images that will not look like any other in our group shoot.</p> <p>LOCATION:</p> <p><a href=""https://thisopenspace.com/spaces/3930-bright-loft-studio-on-main-st"" class=""linkified"">https://thisopenspace.com/spaces/3930-bright-loft-studio-on-main-st</a></p> <p>Main Intersection: Cambie and W Broadway<br/>I will send the exact address via private message after you sign up.</p> <p>MY CONTACT:</p> <p>Message me on Facebook (search Kate Snig) or call/text at six four seven nine seven five seven two zero one.

Dozens of buttons and menu options can send the new user screaming into the night, and even faze the seasoned pro going digital after decades of film experience. This three-hour program will concentrate on the new and confusing concepts of digital photography and high tech cameras. Learn how, and why to shoot in RAW as compared to JPEG. Learn how to read and utilize the RGB histograms, how to “expose to the right”, and where to place your priority in exposure. Discover what all the different autofocus modes actually do and how to utilize the various noise reduction modes in camera. Master white balance and learn how to set a custom white balance for accurate neutral colors. We will walk though the menus of both the high end Sony DSLR’s and the new Sony mirrorless bodies. We will show you how to adjust the settings in your menu that will solve a variety of real-world problems. This is NOT an entry level class. Students are expected to already understand f/stops and shutter speeds. We will not cover the use of your camera as a digital video camera.</p> <p>To register please click on link: <a href=""https://www.midwest.photography/coursedetail.php?cdn=110"" class=""linkified"">https://www.midwest.photography/coursedetail.php?cdn=110</a></p>",

The studio provides an instruction‐based painting environment in which students can choose and carry out their own assignments, exploring a variety of techniques in acrylics and/or oils* under the instructor’s guidance. Goals will be tailored to each student’s needs and skill level, with emphasis on successful concept development, composition, and development of personal style.</p> <p>The format of the class will be that of an ongoing atelier. We welcome developing artists, ages 15 and up, anytime. No previous painting experience is required. Number of sessions will be up to each student depending on their goals and projects. Students are required to provide their own materials.</p> <p>Please note we will not be covering watercolors in this course.</p> <p>Price: $15 per session.</p> <p>$120 for 10 sessions if paid up front.</p> <p>Cash/Check/Credit Card (we use the square)</p> <p>NO REFUNDS—This will encourage you to come to class.</p> <p>MATERIALS<br/>Students can begin with a basic set of materials, and add to their tool kit as needed.</p> <p>Substrates:<br/>We will be painting on canvas. Stretched canvas is preferred for formal projects, canvas sheets taped to a solid substrate are a great for exercises. Recommended canvas size for beginners is 12” x 18”.</p> <p>Brushes:<br/>Each student may require different brush sets depending on their goals. I find that it works best to pick brushes according to the painting style the student is interested in, rather than the medium. Bristle brushes work best for thick, texture-driven applications, such as impressionism or freestyle explorations. Synthetic (White or Golden Taklon) brushes are best for medium to thin paint, more suitable for figurative, realism-driven paintings. Soft hair brushes are good for very thin paint as well as dry brushing. This will all be explored in class on an individual basis as well.</p> <p>Paints set should include the following to start:<br/>Titanium White<br/>Ivory Black<br/>Cadmium Red Hue*<br/>Cadmium Yellow Hue*<br/>Phtalo Blue<br/>Phtalo Green<br/>Raw Umber</p> <p>Other pigments will be recommended on an individual basis.<br/>Note: do NOT buy, or use in class, the actual Cadmium‐pigment paint, as it is highly toxic and requires special handling. The fake one (It’ll read “Hue”) is just fine.</p> <p>Other Materials:<br/>Painter’s palette(s).<br/>Small, medium and large palette knives (plastic ok).<br/>Odorless turpentine for oil painting.<br/>Graphite Pencil<br/>Pencil Sharpener / Xacto Knife<br/>Kneaded Eraser<br/>Ruler<br/>Containers for Liquids<br/>Towels - Yellow Microfiber or Blue Shop Towels are great.</p> <p>See you in class!</p> <p>About the Instructor</p> <p>Angel Villanueva is a Pomona‐based artist painting in the Magical Realist style.

Small objects of art jewelry are beautifully represented in juxtaposition to larger, sculptural objects. Somehow, the exquisite automobile photography of Patina artist, Michael Furman eloquently coalesces with that of the mixed media sculpture of other Patina artist, Betsy Youngquist.</p> <p>Through Girard's commended command of design, which had an impact on Ivan for most of his life, he was compelled early on to make decisions in design in concern to the gallery, which continue to impact the narrative of Patina as well as the immersive experience lent to our community of collectors.</p>",

There are many wonderful institutions to visit like the Edo-Tokyo Museum / 江戸東京博物館 and The Gallery of Horyu-ji Treasures / 法隆寺 where you can view both traditional and contemporary Japanese Art. Many of these museums are purpose-built. Some of them are in fact breathtaking. There are also several museums that live in more humble surroundings. Typical Tokyo office towers. Whether because of the vagaries of expensive Tokyo real-estate or the commonality of architecture between the companies that brought fortune and what that fortune purchased. These museums are often living on several floors of a working office tower and visiting them can feel a little like going to work!</p> <p>I bring this up because there are institutions popping up in Hong Kong that fit this description. One of them is the new Sun Museum / 一新美術館 in Kwun Tong. Currently housed in the SML Tower on the fourth floor, this museum is showing an exhibition of Dreams of Chinese Painters<br/>Yitao Collection - 丹青夢 一濤居藏品.</p> <p>This exhibition highlights 50 pieces from the Yitao Collection ranging in work from the late Ming / early Qing period through the present day. They include pieces from Bada Shanren - 八大山人 and Shitou - 石濤 as well as Qi Baishi - 齊白石 and Zhang Daqian - 張大千. This is a great opportunity to see works from some of the most important Chinese painters in several generations in a quiet contemplative space.</p> <p>Sacred Spaces has been granted an English language docent lead tour of both the facilities and the exhibit. Both are FREE of charge BUT due to limited space will be reserved for Sacred Spaces Society MEMBERS ONLY. Society membership is separate from the Meetup group.

As years passed and the party outgrew the apartment, the graphic design company Jessi, Josh, and Creighton founded, WORKSHOP, began hosting the event as a way to impart our organization’s personality and values. In 2012, Casson Rosenblatt was added to the official organizing body. Brooklyn Derby has moved to larger and larger venues and multiplied in size to over 500 revelers. But it is still lovingly held in the same spirit - good food, good drink, good people, good fun.</p>",

While there we'll be doing a quick workshop and handing out astro notes while waiting for our food to be served</p> <p><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@-37.9689917,144.4939224,15z"" class=""linkified"">https://www.google.com/maps/@-37.9689917,144.4939224,15z</a></p> <p>At 7.00 we head out into the night to capture the Stars, Planets and Milky Way. We have several excellent locations lined up all within walking distance of the pub that will help add an extra dimension to your images. We plan to continue shooting until 9.30pm but I'm sure some will linger longer if the conditions are good. If there is total cloud cover we will do some light painting, light writing and nightscape photography instead. These are all fun techniques that can result in fantastic images</p> <p>A lot of planning has gone into this so we need everyone to be totally aware of the minimum equipment requirements needed to make this a worthwhile event where you can participate fully and get good results</p> <p>· Camera capable of shooting at high ISO's (1600 to 3200)</p> <p>· A wide angle lens (from 10mm up to 50mm) with large aperture - F2.8 or F4</p> <p>· Cable release / remote (self-timer in camera can be used, too)</p> <p>· A spare battery as the cold and long exposures drain batteries quickly</p> <p>· A sturdy tripod</p> <p>· A red light (torch or headlamp).</p> <p>· Warm, weatherproof clothing including gloves, boots, scarfs etc.</p> <p>· Fold up chair (as compact as possible)</p> <p>This event is not intended to teach participants how to use their cameras. Instead it's aim is to help you capture astro shots. So please understand the general principles of how your camera operates, where all the buttons and dials are to make adjustments (in what will be dim light) to aperture, ISO &amp; shutter speed, how to focus your lens in manual focus, how to use DSLR live view etc. If you're not sure go to ""You Tube"" or ""Google"" for instructions or ask a question in comments before the event.<br/>We'll be running a workshop in the pub before we start the night portion of the event but this will all be about the settings, equipment, tools and techniques you need for astro, light writing and light painting.</p> <p>Image by Katja Gutwein</p>",

There is 0 reception but a good idea would be to download offline maps using the google app. A few people that went did that and it was great to simply go explore without fear of getting lost. There are lots of creatures roaming around like beetles, mice/rats? small scorpions, lizards, and mosquitos. Bring bug spray. I think total walking will probably be around 3 miles.<br/>I have 4 long range radio walkie-talkie's that will be distributed to a few to keep in contact at all times.

Throughout the class, you will learn proper exposure and composition techniques, as well as tips and tricks for taking beautiful landscape photographs. The class will end just around sunset so you have the opportunity to put what you learned to use by capturing images of a beautiful coastal sunset. Hopefully we'll get some clouds.</p> <p>This class will cover how to use circular polarizer filters, neutral density filters, graduated neutral density filters, how to get a proper exposure for landscapes with your camera's built-in light meter and with an incident handheld light meter, landscape composition techniques, how to shoot a sunset, silhouettes, and also how to take HDR exposures.</p> <p>** This class does not cover how to use your camera.

We guarantee you will love them! If you don't have them for this class, you'll definitely wish you did. These are a landscape photographer's secret tool. They are a great investment and will allow you to get a proper exposure for both the sky and foreground. You'll need three separate parts (the adapter ring the same size as your lens' filter ring, the filter holder, and the filters themselves)<br/>Ideally, you want a ND8 Hard Grad and a ND8 Soft Grad.</p> <p>Here are some Amazon links to filters we recommend:</p> <p>Budget option - Neewer Graduated ND Filter Kit - <a href=""http://a.co/4MgcY11"" class=""linkified"">http://a.co/4MgcY11</a></p> <p>Intermediate Option: Cokin P-Series Filters (recommended)<br/>ND8 Hard Gradient - <a href=""http://a.co/8eFWdZZ"" class=""linkified"">http://a.co/8eFWdZZ</a><br/>ND8 Soft Gradient - <a href=""http://a.co/gvXWfmr"" class=""linkified"">http://a.co/gvXWfmr</a><br/>Filter Holder and Adaptor Ring (buy for your lens' filter size) - <a href=""http://a.co/bBTujIb"" class=""linkified"">http://a.co/bBTujIb</a></p> <p>If you want the heavy duty expensive ones or if your lens' filter size diameter is 77mm or larger, check out LEE Filters (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/kbkakut"" class=""linkified"">http://tinyurl.com/kbkakut</a>).</p> <p>*** You can also pick these up locally at Nelson Photo Supplies or George's Camera. If you go to Nelson Photo Supplies, tell them Nick and Don from The Workshoppe sent you and they may give you a discount. ***</p> <p>—————————————————————————————</p> <p>Tripods - Don't underestimate them.</p> <p>If you need a tripod, here are some tips for buying a tripod:</p> <p>1. Material - Aluminum is most affordable, but it can be heavy. Carbon fiber weighs less but more expensive (good if you hike and travel).</p> <p>2. Heads - Ball head or 3 way pan/tilt. Ball heads are faster and more easy to use, but the pan/tilt allows more precise individual adjustments of each angle.</p> <p>3. Size - Look for a tripod with thick leg diameter. The larger the legs, the more sturdy it will be.</p> <p>4. Adjustability - Look for a tripod where each leg can be independently adjusted for angle and length. Don't buy a tripod where the legs are connected with crossbars as this limits it use on uneven terrain.</p> <p>We recommend the following brands and models:</p> <p>Dolica, Manfrotto, Induro, Benro, MeFoto (for small travel tripods), Gitzo (expensive), Really Right Stuff (expensive).</p> <p>Dolica Tripod (Good and very affordable) -</p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B001D60LG8"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B001D60LG8</a></p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B001DIKUYE"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B001DIKUYE</a></p> <p>MeFoto Travel Tripod (Small, lightweight, and affordable) -</p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B00BETIVWK"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B00BETIVWK</a></p> <p>Manfrotto Tripod Kits(Good and affordable tripod kits) -</p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B00COLBNTK"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B00COLBNTK</a></p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B00MAMHNWE"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B00MAMHNWE</a></p> <p>Manfrotto Tripod Legs Only (Excellent for serious shooters) - <a href=""http://amzn.com/B00G36G7WU"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B00G36G7WU</a></p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B00M8KBE00"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B00M8KBE00</a></p> <p>Manfrotto 3-way Head (for the Manfrotto tripod legs above) - <a href=""http://amzn.com/B000H0338Y"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B000H0338Y</a></p> <p><a href=""http://amzn.com/B00IT0AMBU"" class=""linkified"">http://amzn.com/B00IT0AMBU</a></p> <p>—————————————————————————————</p> <p>Where We WIll Meet:</p> <p>Group will meet at Cuvier Park overlooking the tide pools.</p> <p>—————————————————————————————–</p> <p>Important Notes:</p> <p>We recommend that you dress comfortably, wear closed-toed shoes capable of walking over wet rocks and sand, wear sunscreen, and bring a water bottle.</p> <p>This area is busy on the weekend so show up at least 15-30 minutes early to find parking.

Para celebrar esta edición hemos decidido trasladarnos cerca de la playa, a la zona del Cabanyal, ya que empieza el buen tiempo a pesar de los chaparrones de semana santa. Todavía no hemos realizado ningún intercambio por esta zona de la ciudad y nos apetecía mucho. El lugar del intercambio es Drassanes 52 un centro cultural que abrió sus puertas hace poco más de un año.</p> <p>Como novedad en esta edición, en vez de traer la ropa unos días antes del intercambio, para poder valorarla y etiquetarla, se traerá el primer día del intercambio a las 16h. El intercambio no empezará hasta las 17h para que podamos colgar las prendas. Durante esa hora, podréis escuchar a Pilar Quintana, especialista del orden que ya ha colaborado en anteriores ediciones y que nos hablará sobre su libro “Reto de las 16 semanas para ordenarte”. Antes Josep y Cristina nos contaran brevemente lo que hacen en Drassanes 52. En cambio, si durante esa hora queréis daros una vuelta por la playa…no vamos a culparos por ello!</p> <p>Este intercambio lo hemos pensado de manera que podáis organizaros planes alrededor de la playa. Planes que hemos pensado:</p> <p>Plan sábado</p> <p>Para los que planeéis venir el sábado, en Drassanes por la mañana tienen un Taller de Desayuno Detox de[masked]h ( <a href=""http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/detox/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/detox/</a> ) . Si os interesa podéis venir al taller, comer por la zona y acercaros de nuevo a las 16h al intercambio.</p> <p>Plan domingo</p> <p>Si en cambio prefieres venir el domingo al intercambio, puedes venir de 12-14h y quedarte a la comida especial que hacen en Drassanes a las 14.30h de “Arròs del Senyoret” por 10€ ( <a href=""http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/especial-arros-del-senyoret/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.drassanes52.net/actividades/especial-arros-del-senyoret/</a> ).</p> <p>+INFO: <a href=""https://dearmarioaarmario.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/20o-intercambio-de-ropa/"" class=""linkified"">https://dearmarioaarmario.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/20o-intercambio-de-ropa/</a></p>",

I will have everything taken care of for you. The models, makeup artists, and wardrobe! You may bring your lights if you would like!</p> <p>While this shoot is for portfolio building and not a workshop learning experience, I will be there if you have any questions, or you can learn from your fellow photographers by watching them!</p> <p>*** RULES***</p> <p>You must upload photos in high res to the meetup group page here after the shoot.</p> <p>At least one shot of each model that you end up shooting! This will make it so much easier for the models/creative team to just download the shots! If you have many shots you can email the models and creative team with a link to your photos. But you do need to upload at least one shot of every model you shot with here on the meetup page after the shoot!</p> <p>Plus that way I can keep track of the people that do not upload photos!</p> <p>Show them off on the facebook group page as well if you like!</p> <p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/SoCalFashionPhotoshoots/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/SoCalFashionPhotoshoots/</a></p> <p>But definitely, upload them to this meetup page!</p> <p>***PRICING***</p> <p>$20 per photographer</p> <p>I book a 1 to 2 photographers per model ratio! I overbook because I know there are flakes! I always try to have back up models and replace the models that bail on us. I, unfortunately, can not do anything about the models that bail at the last second or are no call/no shows but I do everything I can to have at least 1 model for every 2 photographers! usually, it's an even better ratio than that!</p> <p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p> <p>-Please provide your own model releases if you must have them. Models have the right to refuse to sign anything.</p> <p>- This Meetup does not do groups/rotations! I do not like to tell the photographers who to stick with and who to shoot. You are free to shoot with anyone. You do not have to shoot the models you do not want to shoot.</p> <p>-Please be friendly and courteous! While there will most likely be enough models to do one on ones just also expect to shoot the models with multiple photographers at once</p> <p>- Do not touch the models before asking. No grabbing them or placing them where you want them. Ask them if it is ok to place them where you want them before doing so.</p> <p>- No generators</p> <p>Hope to see ya there!</p> <p>Tawny</p> <p>REFUND POLICY: Meetups are like Concerts, If you have to cancel you can sell or give your ticket to someone else. I can try and help you with this but No refunds.</p>",

Such a crisis has arisen, and it is up to all of you to come together now and join in the effort of addressing it. Just what is this crisis, you ask? Well, which movie will we see, of course. The options are as follows:</p> <p>Avengers: Endgame</p> <p>The Curse of La Llorona</p> <p>Breakthrough</p> <p>Little</p> <p>Choose wisely and choose well, but only choose one. If you mention more than one movie in your vote, I won’t count it at all. Does that make me a despotic tyrant? Very possibly, but to do otherwise would be to court chaos.</p> <p>The dinner will be either before or after the movie, depending on which movie wins and what time it’s playing. We’ll be eating at the Skylight Diner, about a block away from the theater. The service is charmingly rude, but they seat large groups easily, so we continue our humble patronage with them.</p> <p>After the dinner or the movie, for those who don’t wish the evening to end, we’ll grab some drinks at a nearby bar and continue our level discourse and discussion- or just talk and stuff.</p>",

We live under light-polluted skies and to see a glimpse of the Milkyway, we need to travel outside the city. Stay outside in full darkness for a few minutes, then look up. There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:26 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

It is across the river from West Point. More importantly, it is south of Storm King mountain and Breakneck Ridge. The marsh has some boardwalks and a very interesting view of the the two mountains on each side of the Hudson River which form a vee shape with the river at the bottom.</p> <p>The sun rises at 5:45 and around 6:45 am the sun will rise to about 10 degrees and begin to peek over the ridge to the east. This will allow early light to begin to fall on Storm King mountain, while Breakneck Ridge remains in the shadows. If we are fortunate to have some clouds over the river we might also get some great sky color.</p> <p>There is an opportunity to capture activity in the marsh including birds.</p> <p>Afterwards we will hike back up the hill to the parking lot and a short distance further to Indian Brook Falls. There is another nearby double falls by Philipstown Park. We will have an option to photograph these falls too.</p> <p>The parking lot is limited to 8 cars only. Since the plan is to arrive very early and before the marsh opens to the public this shouldn't be a problem. The marsh is managed by the Audubon Society and they require we indicate in advance how many people will be participating, so RSVP is important. We will have special permission to access the marsh before it opens to the public.</p> <p>Important - if there is great interest for this shoot but the morning hour is a challenge, let me know. There is a similar opportunity to capture the sunset in this same location. I am willing to do a sunset version of this meetup on the prior Saturday evening.</p> <p>Things you should bring with you. Tripod. I strongly suggest hiking shoes. The access trail is hilly in spots, rocky in spots, and wet in some spots. It is a short walk from the parking to the boardwalk but the wooded sections really need a firm shoe to get through the trail. I also suggest bug spray.</p> <p>By sending in an RSVP and joining this meetup event hosted by the NANPA Nature Photography Group of New York and New Jersey, I am also agreeing to the terms of the following release and waiver of liability, which shall be binding on my heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns.

It's not a stretch to say that ""Hawaiian waterfall"" comes to mind when you visit Race Brook during the summer months.

Don't hesitate if you're thinking this is good for you, just do it. Rooms fill up long before you'd think. You don't need to stay the whole week, but after the first day, you'll want to.

Organizing a bike ride for a bunch of hikers is a challenge. There are potentially so many different skill levels. I'd like for us to be able to ride together so I'm going to try to provide some guidelines to support that notion. Please do not take offense unless you are a masochist, then by all means.</p> <p>This is neither a social/ice cream ride nor a hardcore fitness ride. Meaning, you should be able to ride about 10 miles with no more than 1 SHORT break and maintain a speed of at least 10 miles an hour. If not, build up some stamina and join us next time. (I think I ride about 12 mph but am in no hurry.) If you are zoomy-zoomy bike rider, please pick another ride. This is not the venue to demonstrate your prowess.</p> <p>We will meet at Ingle's at 8:31 and head out no later than 8:45. Sorry in advance if you're late. We may be able to carpool by putting more bikes on cars with extra room on their carriers. If you're renting, certainly you can ride with someone else. I don't know if the bike rental shops are open on Sunday, but please make arrangements in advance so you don't get skunked, disappointed or delay the start of the ride.</p> <p>From Ingle's we will drive to Travelers Rest - 1 Grandview Way, Travelers Rest, SC 29690. This may not be the exact address but it's within a stone's throw of where we'll begin. We'll park by the cemetery.</p> <p>The trail is very flat with a few mild inclines. We will ride somewhere between 20 and 25 miles. The trail is easy to follow. If you want to ride less, you should be able to find your way back to the starting point without difficulty. There are restrooms along the way and places to get a drink.</p> <p>I'm sure many of you will have questions that I probably can't answer but please don't let that dissuade you from sending them to me. You probably have an abundance of suggestions as well. Please send those along. Most will be ignored.</p> <p>Helmets are requested but not required by me. I don't know what the state laws are.</p> <p>Repast afterward for those interested.</p> <p>Whiners are not welcome on this ride.</p> <p>Please be patient with everyone - me especially - since this is new territory for this meetup.</p> <p>Fun is MANDATORY!!!</p> <p>TTFN</p>",

In this one-day bootcamp, we will start from the very beginning and progress to a three light setup photographing a model. We’ll start the day off in a lecture setting covering the basics of studio lighting.</p> <p>Topics include<br/>• The different types of lighting equipment available for the studio<br/>• How to safely operate studio lighting equipment<br/>• The difference between LED, CFL and strobe technologies<br/>• A look at the different types of modifiers available – umbrellas, softboxes, etc. and how they change the look of a photo<br/>• What is sync speed and why it is important<br/>• Various methods to connect your camera to strobe lights<br/>From there we will move into a hands-on workshop environment setting up the studio and photographing a model. We will start with a one light set up and add lights one at a time to create a classic three light portrait.</p> <p>Concepts covered in the workshop are<br/>• Placement of lights to control the look of the photograph<br/>• How to use lighting modifiers to change the quality of the light<br/>• Using a light meter to improve exposure accuracy<br/>• Posing your subject for a more flattering look<br/>• Interacting with your subject to make them comfortable</p> <p>Everyone in the class will have the opportunity to photograph a model in each lighting setup. The class is limited to 10 students.</p> <p>Equipment Required<br/>• DSLR or Mirrorless camera with charged batteries<br/>• Clear Memory Cards<br/>• Any and all lenses you hope to use</p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Scott is a photographer based out of Cedar Park, Texas. He has a studio in his home and runs Scott D Photography with his wife, Jennifer. Scott fell in love with photography about 10 years ago while working in Chicago and began the long journey of learning all he could. His favorite subject continues to be the concept of ""urban decay"" and his business focuses on family and children portraiture.</p> <p>Scott loves two things about photography. First, you can never learn it all. Second, the industry is brimming with other professionals willing and enthusiastic about guiding you through your next photographic adventure. Teaching has always been a passion for Scott, and he's thrilled to continue that passion.</p>",

Bring your camera, tripod, neutral density (ND) filter, and remote cable release (you can also use your timer). I have a few spare Yongnuo triggers for Canon and Nikon, and a few spare (77mm) ND filters of varying density that can be borrowed for this.</p> <p>For the ND filter, you will probably want something that's a 2 or 3-stop filter. You can go as high as a 10-stop, but shouldn't need anything beyond that.</p> <p>Models are welcome to join us. There are many places around the area that could be used for backdrops for portraits. Dress can be whatever the models like, nothing specific. We can try some photos in/near the water as well (if the weather permits). Since this is a long exposure waterfall shoot, the first 30-45 minutes or so will be for photographing waterfalls (so we aren't getting in each other's shots) and then the remainder of the time can be for whatever (waterfalls or portraits). I will have a changing tent available if models want to bring different outfits. There will not be an MUA for this. Models will be responsible for their own makeup.</p> <p>Please keep lighting equipment to a minimum. Ideally, just a flash and small diffuser or small softbox on a stand. No large softboxes. You will need to carry your equipment with you.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: Parking is VERY LIMITED at the meetup point given on the map. There is a larger parking lot but you will have to walk a bit to get to the meetup point. If need be we can maybe shuttle some people in/out from the main parking lot. Please use the address given to get right to the spot where we will be meeting (If you just put in Waterfall Glen into your GPS, it will probably put you at the wrong spot and you will have to walk a considerable amount).</p> <p>*** NOTE: Priority will be giving to those who did not attend the previous waterfall shoot(s). The organizer reserves the right to place people at the end of the wait list if they have already attended one of these.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please post a comment below. Models can add themselves. This is a free event. Please keep in mind that this is a public place so there maybe be other people present in the park/area. I am going to keep the number small and will adjust as necessary. I will probably do more of these shoots in the future if you don't get a spot for this one.</p>",

You can also make arrangements to travel with and meetup with other members by using the discussion section of this page.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this will likely be a nice May Sunday, and there may be quite a crowd trying to get there by car, so please consider carpooling and public transportation (see <a href=""https://www.philadelphiazoo.org/Visit/Public-Transportation.htm"" class=""linkified"">https://www.philadelphiazoo.org/Visit/Public-Transportation.htm</a> )</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p>Cheers!<br/>Steve Rosenbach, your Organizer</p>",

Remnants of the former cattle ranching days can be seen throughout the park.</p> <p>Though 90% of the park burned in the Santiago Fire of 2007, the land is still in the recovery process. Please respect that process by staying on marked trails and following park rules.</p> <p><img src=""http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/7/5/600_457699061.jpeg"" /></p> <p>There are no restrooms on the trail, but a few of the local businesses (Starbucks at least) do have them... and I think that's it...

This exhibition will be on display May 5, 2019 - October 27, 2019.</p> <p>Alexander Girard was one of the most influential interior and textile designers of the 20th century. Alexander Girard: A Designer’s Universe is the first major retrospective on Girard’s work, organized by the Vitra Design Museum in Germany. It opens a door to his creative universe and shows his close relationships with contemporaries such as Charles &amp; Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen, Andy Warhol, Rudi Gernreich, and many others. Featured are Girard’s designs in textiles, furniture, and sculptures, as well as numerous sketches, drawings, and collages never shown before.</p> <p>Girard was also a pivotal figure in the history of the Museum of International Folk Art, donating more than 100,000 objects from his and his wife Susan’s folk art collection, and in 1981 creating the museum’s long-term, beloved exhibition Multiple Visions. Girard’s playful designs attest to a passion for colors, ornamentation, and inspirations from folk art.</p> <p>Coinciding with this traveling retrospective, the Museum of International Folk Art will enhance the visitor experience of its Girard collection exhibition, Multiple Visions, through interpretive and interactive elements designed for the 21st century.</p> <p>New Mexico residents admitted FREE the first Sunday of each month.

We will visit two gardens: the Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens, and Cloudehill Gardens.</p> <p>The Alfred Nicholas Gardens are known for its picturesque waterfalls, water features, and iconic ornamental lake and boathouse. The gardens are operated by Parks Victoria – entry is free. A variety of native birds may be seen in the gardens including king parrots and colourful rosellas. There are ducks in the lake and kookaburras can often be heard in the treetops. There is a blend of native and exotic trees including mountain ash, ginkgoes, maples and liquid ambers. Colour is provided throughout the year by a variety of flowering exotic shrubs, bulbs and trees.</p> <p>Our second stop is Cloudehill Gardens (entry $10) – spend some time wandering around the 20 garden areas threaded through 80 year old European beech, magnolias, maples and a collection of Himalayan tree rhododendrons, all beautifully grown and a testament to the lush, moist soils of the Dandenongs. The garden is highlighted by glorious herbaceous borders which focus on two of the finest Japanese weeping maples to be seen anywhere in the world. ($10 entry fee to gardens, payable in the garden shop, on arrival). Feel free to visit the Diggers Nursery and retail shop.</p> <p>Bring a tripod if you would like to do some macro photography.</p> <p>We will conclude with drinks/dinner at a local pub at the end of the day.</p> <p>All visitors, friends and members of the Melbourne Camera Club are welcome.</p> <p>Please allow a little extra time for car parking if the gardens are busy – there are designated car parks at each garden, but also plenty of parking on the side of the road.</p> <p>Date: Sunday 5 May<br/>Time: 1.00pm for a 1.15pm start<br/>Meeting Location: Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens, 1A Sherbrooke Rd, Sherbrooke – meet inside main gate<br/>Duration: 4 hours, plus dinner<br/>Cost: $10.00 garden entry for Cloudehill Gardens (Free entry at Alfred Nicholas Gardens)</p> <p>Image: Sally Paterson <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sallyp_melb/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/sallyp_melb/</a></p>",

There are several locations for landscape photos that we can take in the golden hours, on a cloudy day, or at night. Some of the places we can photograph are the Bodie Lighthouse (We'll make several trips to this location for sunrise or sunset, and on a clear night with the Milky Way), Nags Head Pier (perfect for morning/evening, stormy days and at night), Pea Island Wildlife Refuge, Jannette’s Pier, Coquina beach, and Jockey’s Ridge State Park. There are two refuges within 30 minutes of Nags Head that house a robust amount of wildlife from black bears and wolves to neotripocal songbirds and snakes. We will attempt to visit both of these refuges: Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>Recommended gear/equipment: wide angle lens, filters such as ND and Polarizing filter, sturdy tripod, telephoto lens and possibly your macro lens. The beach can be damaging to photography equipment. I've learned the hard way not to collapse the legs of my tripod before washing them off. Also, make sure you have a lens cleaner and a cloth to wipe off sea spray. A red light and head lamp are always good to have when shooting at night.</p> <p>Tips:<br/>The refuges are filled with creepy, crawly insects and reptiles, so be sure to wear appropriate clothing such as boots, gaiters, long pants, and a hat. I highly recommend that you download the maps of the area (in particular the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge) onto your phone so you can access them when you don't have a cell phone signal (the refuge is quite large and the roads can be confusing).<br/>------------------<br/>Please view/download the following PDFs from DropBox to find more information about our schedule, points of interest, accommodations, and dining.<br/>Schedule: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/zsops9jfufrvzp3/Schedule-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zsops9jfufrvzp3/Schedule-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Points of Interest: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ho6b2jffia2aj2/PointsofInterest-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ho6b2jffia2aj2/PointsofInterest-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Accommodations: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/565fd294ncabqec/Accommodations-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/565fd294ncabqec/Accommodations-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a><br/>Dining: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3mrdrxcun9lq2/Dining-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3mrdrxcun9lq2/Dining-NagsHead.pdf?dl=0</a></p> <p>A little bit about Nags Head and surrounding areas:<br/>Nags Head is arguably one of the Outer Banks' most established tourism destinations, and the area remains popular with visitors today for its wealth of amenities, sprawling ocean and soundfront views, and classic Outer Banks style. In Nags Head, a beach-loving vacationer can find virtually anything to make an OBX vacation perfect, including some of the area's favorite restaurants, natural and historical attractions, and miles of fun. Visitors come here year after year for the fantastic Outer Banks beaches and ample entertainment, and have been doing so for generations. An ideal mix of on-the-beach relaxation and off-the-beach amusements, Nags Head remains one of the Outer Banks' most loved vacation destinations.<br/>----------------<br/>Useful Links:<br/>Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge: <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Pea_Island/visit/plan_your_visit.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Pea_Island/visit/plan_your_visit.html</a><br/>Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge: <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/seasons_of_wildlife/index.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/seasons_of_wildlife/index.html</a><br/>Jockey’s Ridge State Park: <a href=""https://www.ncparks.gov/jockeys-ridge-state-park"" class=""linkified"">https://www.ncparks.gov/jockeys-ridge-state-park</a><br/>Outer Banks.com: <a href=""https://www.outerbanks.com/nags-head.html"" class=""linkified"">https://www.outerbanks.com/nags-head.html</a></p> <p>---------------<br/>Please read our disclaimer for this event in the link below.

I'll be helping everyone individually and answering any questions that arise.</p> <p>WHAT TO BRING</p> <p>Your camera of course, any kind of camera is fine as long as it has MANUAL settings. If you only have a phone as your camera, you probably won't benefit too much from this session.</p> <p>Please bring your instruction manual is possible. Every camera is different, I don't know them all, and a manual may possibly save us some time looking for specific settings.

I would recommend him!"" - Tiffany</p> <p>""This was a great learning experience. John was on time and he started to get straight into photography. This experience gave me a different perspective of photography in terms of angles, images story, composition, and utilization of lighting. John is very knowledgable and passionate, hence does answer our specific queries, which was very helpful."" - Amal</p> <p>""Yes. Take John's class. He helped me become a better photographer with one lesson ... John showed up on his longboard, gave me a hug, shared interesting backstories about his hometown of Manhattan Beach, and delivered concrete advice that made sense. From social media and travel, to photo editing, sky diving, philosophy, and brand campaign work, John knows a lot of interesting stuff about a lot of things. He's friendly, down to earth, and legit. I like that he earns real money to shoot. It's not just a hobby. Bottom line: Fun time, awesome value, smart takeaways. Thx, John!"" - Ann</p> <p>""Holy moly! John is incredible! He taught me a lot about photography as a beginner and explained the fundamentals from perspective to composition and everything else there is so much to learn.

The hike has a generally soft, even and easy on your body hiking surface as well as beautiful riparian and canyon scenery. This fast paced, short duration hike is excellent for all skill levels and would be beneficial as a recovery hike from the weekend or a fast paced cardio hike to start the week. This is an out and back hike paralleling the Deschutes River, hiking towards Tumalo State Park and return. We can meet for brunch/lunch afterwards if there is any interest.</p> <p>Hike Start: Please arrive 10 minutes early; in consideration of your fellow hikers be prepared to hike at 9 AM.</p> <p>Water: Due to the hike's brevity make sure to hydrate prior to the event.</p> <p>Restroom: At trail head and a portable toilet at turnaround point.</p> <p>HIKE DETAILS:<br/>* Activity Level: Moderate+<br/>* Mileage: 6.8 total miles, 300' elevation gain/loss<br/>* Pace: 3+ miles/hour<br/>* What to bring: Water, trail snacks and The Ten Essentials<br/>* Clothing: Appropriate for the conditions<br/>* Carpool to Bend: Use the comments section to arrange<br/>* Permits or Parking Fees: None<br/>* Dogs: Per park rules are not permitted, on or off leash.</p> <p>The Ten Essentials Description:<br/><a href=""https://www.mountaineers.org/blog/what-are-the-ten-essentials"" class=""linkified"">https://www.mountaineers.org/blog/what-are-the-ten-essentials</a> and</p> <p>Be prepared for adverse weather conditions.

This mostly rugged terrain offers a near-to-home nature experience unlike others provided by Bend Park &amp; Recreation District.</p> <p>From its unique location adjacent to the Deschutes River, Riley Ranch Nature Reserve offers dramatic views of the Cascade Mountain Range and the river canyon.</p> <p>Appearing relatively untouched in some places, the land features open meadows, juniper and pine forests, unique lava flows, cliffs and the river’s rocky canyon. The park is host to many native plant species, migratory birds and wildlife.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.bendparksandrec.org/park/riley-ranch-nature-reserve/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.bendparksandrec.org/park/riley-ranch-nature-reserve/</a></p>",

If the description was read it would be seen it was not for an actual meetup itself.<br/><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/The-Edinburgh-Photography-Meetup-Group/events/259443043/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.meetup.com/The-Edinburgh-Photography-Meetup-Group/events/259443043/</a></p> <p>Apologies for any confusion. This event detailed below, however, is for an actual meetup and will be taking place on the dates shown.</p> <p>This is an open photography trip to Glencoe to allow members to take the type of shots that are impossible to do on our Thursday afternoon jaunts. While it is nominally for three-nights members can choose how long they would like to go for and where they would like to stay. For campers, I would suggest booking Invercoe campsite, <a href=""http://www.invercoe.co.uk"" class=""linkified"">http://www.invercoe.co.uk</a>. Cottages, Lodges and Caravans are also available for hire from their website. Micro pods are also available from <a href=""https://www.invercoe.co.uk/micro-lodges-in-glencoe/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.invercoe.co.uk/micro-lodges-in-glencoe/</a>, as are the regular hotels and BBs.</p> <p>Glencoe was chosen for this first trip as there is a great variety of accommodation available in the area and it is a spectacular location.<br/>Everyone will be responsible for booking their own accommodation, though it may be an idea to team up with someone if you are looking to rent a pod or Cottage. Once we know all who are going we can work out lifts for those who require them.</p> <p>As the group is very much one for free spirits, no rules, there would none the less be a morning/evening meetup​ each day at a suitable location where options could be discussed for photographic trips for that day. Members would then be free to go off with others or on their own. Weather depending, arrangements could also be made to photograph, sunrises/sunsets. Astrophotography may also be possible as May 4th is the date for the new moon. Best times for these dates 7th May - 9th are from 11 pm till around 2 am. Obviously, this being Scotland the weather would be the limiting factor.</p> <p>The first thing to do is if you are interested is to put your name down.</p> <p>This is the first time, to my knowledge, that this type of trip has been suggested but it should be noted that each member is responsible for organising her/his own accommodation and transport.<br/>I accept no responsibility if it all goes tits up!</p>",

While working in the fast-paced High-Tech world, he found relaxation in nature and wildlife photography. Over the years he honed his skills and in the early 2000’s took the step to become a part time professional. Since his retirement from the corporate world he and his wife Nadine have “focused” on nature, wildlife and travel photography, mostly teaching in the classroom and holding workshops in the field. Bob has been teaching and lecturing at many Colorado venues including the Rocky Mountain Conservancy, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Highlands Ranch Community Association, Arapahoe Library District, Douglas County Library District, High Plains Library District, Gardens at Spring Creek in Fort Collins and numerous local camera clubs. He has written four eBooks: Macro Photography - Bringing the Small World to Life, Travel Photography for Fun and Profit(?), Depth of field: A Photographers Guide to Understanding Focus and Digital Nature Photography - Nature and Wildlife for the Outdoor Photographer. His stock file includes images ranging from Alaska to Australia, South America to Europe and Asia. He has extensive experience in the western U.S., especially Colorado and California. Published images and articles have appeared in magazines and newsletters including Falcon, Outdoor World, and several photo newsletters. He was an assistant editor and featured writer/photographer for First Light Monthly Newsletter for Nature Photographers. He is also president of the Colorado Urban Wildlife Photo Club.</p> <p>Please join us and learn all about ""Photographing Colorado’s Mountain Towns""!</p> <p>Colorado’s mountains are full of historic mining towns. Some are vibrant tourist spots, others quiet vacation spots and still others have faded away leaving, at best, a few dilapidated structures. They are all full of photo opportunities. This presentation takes the audience to over a dozen towns and explores their history, current status, a glimpse into their future and of course, opportunities for great photographs. We also discuss the ins and outs of travel to these towns and provide some recommended camera gear for the journey.</p>",

PayReel will cover these issues and more.</p> <p>PayReel: PayReel’s compliance management services take the stress out of hiring freelance employees by meeting all Employer obligations at all jurisdictional levels. Risk mitigation is best managed by smart safety programs and insurance measures. PayReel’s robust insurance policies conform to meet small business needs to large corporate and financial institution requirements and guarantee the highest level of protection for clients.</p> <p>Workers’ Compensation<br/>EPL<br/>General Liability<br/>Professional Liability<br/>Cyber and drone Insurance<br/>Auto, foreign and more</p> <p>WORKER CLASSIFICATION BEST PRACTICES: Accurate worker classification, in our world, is a must. With the rapid growth of the independent workforce, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in scrutiny by the IRS and state labor agencies to ensure workers are appropriately classified. Misclassifying workers as independent contractors presents a huge risk for any enterprise. PayReel will help ensure that all your freelance contractors are properly classified by vetting the work, the worker’s role, evaluating the risk and making a classification decision.<br/>The IRS has very strict guidelines that define true business-to-business relationships and payroll compliance. These guidelines are meant to prevent firms from misclassifying would-be employees and thereby avoid, either knowingly or unknowingly, a bounty of state and federal taxes.</p> <p>Key things to require when working with an IC</p> <p>Your contractor has an established business entity, with a business name and EIN to which invoice payment is made<br/>Your contractor provides services to other businesses outside your firm<br/>Your IC provides certificates of insurance, including at the least, coverage for general liability insurance and workers’ comp insurance<br/>You have a signed per project Agreement for Services between your company and the contractor<br/>In the context of hiring independent contractors and contingent workforce regulations, PayReel pays close attention to all employer obligations at the federal, state and local levels, including wage &amp; hour rules, per diem, ACA tracking, and sick leave mandates.</p> <p>NON MEMBERS $10<br/>MEMBERS FREE<br/>Pizza for everyone.<br/>One beer for ASMP members.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;PLEASE BE SURE TO REGISTER HERE FOR THIS EVENT.

They have a lot of different themes running through the next few months from Sci-fi to Latin American to Nordic films, amongst many other great films and other non-film events too. Prices are much lower than commercial cinemas.</p> <p>Nordic Film Nights travels to Denmark this month, screening “The Guilty”. It has excellent reviews on Rotton Tomatoes and sounds very intense (see the description below).</p> <p>Confined to the police station, Asger is forced to use others as his eyes and ears as the severity of the crime slowly becomes more clear. The search to find the missing woman and her assailant will take every bit of his intuition and skill, as a ticking clock and his own personal demons conspire against him.

If you felt the information was worth while when the class is done, I ask that you pay $10. Otherwise, thanks for coming!</p> <p>This class, well its more of a discussion really.... is about your camera. It doesn't matter if you you have an iPhone or an advanced level DSLR, I'll show you how to understand your camera a little better and the basics of how it makes and image.</p> <p>Things we are going to review:<br/>• Understanding your cameras buttons, menus and adjustments.<br/>• Understanding when to use your flash. (ps - just don't do it! Not with your on camera flashes anyway. That is the quickest way to make a photo look eh.)<br/>• Some basic composition techniques and considerations.<br/>• Any questions you have specifically about working your camera. We will try to stay on topic of understanding your camera vs. delving in to understanding how to make a specific type of image with various camera settings. No promises... I get 'passionate' about discussing all things photography!</p> <p>Reminder, this is a very basic class! If you already understand what Time Value is, what ISO stands for or what the benefit of the P on the dial of your DSLR is... THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. My goal with this class is to help would be photographers and those who just love capturing the moments to understand there tool just a little bit better!</p>",

It appears in many places and in many different forms as a gentle reminder of our place in the cosmos. Just as in meditation, tai-chi, and other spiritual and health practices it is up to us to approach the Mandala in hopes that we too can unlock its power. Hong Kong Sacred Spaces is delighted to present an immersive interactive drawing workshop with art instructor Reshma Rohra who will teach us how to draw the Mandala in a deep and meaningful way. Using ink and paper we will explore the meditative qualities of drawing in a mindful and directed way. In this Workshop, you will learn the step-by-step drawing technique of drawing the Mandala to practice mindfulness by setting all your focus on creating a piece of art. No drawing experience needed just a positive outlook and a willingness to learn. All art materials will be provided at the venue.<br/>Workshop Focus:</p> <p>Understanding of Mandalas:<br/>-Learn the Step-by-step Technique for drawing symmetrical Mandalas<br/>-Every Participant's Mandala will be Different from the Other<br/>-Learning about Various Zentangle Patterns and How to Use Them<br/>-Exploring one's Creative Potential with Different Patterns and Colors<br/>-2 Hours of Art Therapy<br/>-Focus on Goal Fulfillment while Drawing<br/>-Understanding the Concept of Mindfulness and Practicing it while<br/>Drawing</p> <p>Workshop takeaway:<br/>-A sense of satisfaction in learning a new form of art<br/>-Benefits of the goal-fulfillment therapy<br/>-The skill to practice Mandalas making after one workshop<br/>-A beautiful piece of art which can be framed</p> <p>Rehma has been kind enough to offer Hong Kong Sacred Spaces Meetup Members a 10% discount.

Currently based in Hong Kong Reshma was born and brought up in India where her interest in Art and Art Therapy began in 2013. Originally thought of as merely an artistic challenge, drawing intricate Mandalas and Zentangle patterns soon became a passion that Reshma has learned to share with those around her. Stroke by stroke, each drawing moving her closer to peace, happiness and a profound sense of fulfillment. This is what she wishes to share with you along with the confidence and awareness of the power of drawing this most beautiful and important symbol.</p>",

Please leave a message in the comments section if you want pizza and have any preference of type.</p> <p>Bring five photos on a flash drive, we'll project them onto a large screen and talk about what works and what doesn't.

If we get too many people we may skip over a few images so the night doesn't get too late.</p> <p>We learn by getting feedback and this is a great place to feel safe and show your work, bring your best or bring something that didn't come out the way you thought it would and we'll help figure out what could have been done differently. We are very informal and it doesn't matter what your skill level is, we have beginners and advanced and everyone learns something! Even if you don't show photos you will get something by attending.</p> <p>Photos should be jpeg format, at least 1920 pixels wide and preferably 72dpi.</p> <p>Since the Adult Day Center has expenses in hosting us and they have a bigger mission than letting people look at photos, we are paying them each month for the space.

We love to see new photography and watch our users experiment with creative styles and techniques. We are device agnostic, happy to see images from full-frame DSLRs, film cameras, smartphones, and others. Our biggest ask is that the photos stay true to your personal vision and to what you saw. Please avoid heavy-handed processing. We want to see the world through your eyes, not through the excessive use of editing tools. If the photograph is manipulated, please describe your process in the caption. Below are some basic photo guidelines.</p> <p>ETHICS: National Geographic supports ethical photography that accurately represents cultures, ecosystems, and wildlife. We expect that the welfare of people, animals, and their environments take precedence over photography. In other words, don’t harm or manipulate the subject or its environment for the sake of creating an image.</p> <p>CAPTION: We insist on truth in captioning and expect full disclosure in the story behind the photo. The description should be complete and accurate. Not only does this establish trust and lend greater credibility to your photo, but it also increases the engagement of the viewer.</p> <p>BURNING AND DODGING: Brightening or darkening specific areas in an image is allowed but should be kept to a minimum and not done to the point where it is obvious. Your goal in using digital darkroom techniques should only be to adjust the dynamic tonal range and color balance of an image so that it more closely resembles what you saw and communicates the mood of the scene.</p> <p>CROPPING: Cropping is allowed, but composing the image in-camera is always ideal.</p> <p>CLONING: Cloning is not allowed.</p> <p>BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY: Converting your color photos to black and white is acceptable.</p> <p>STITCHED PANORAMAS: These are allowed only if the segments were all made within the same time frame. Don't create panoramas with sections made at significantly different times. Do not change focal length while creating a stitched image. Do not stretch the meaning of panorama to include elements that weren't in the scene as you saw it. If your photo is a stitched image, please indicate so in the caption.</p> <p>COMPOSITE OR HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE (HDR): These shots are allowed only if the combined parts are made at the same time. Don't submit final images where the foreground was shot at noon and the sky at sunset. If your photo is an HDR image, please indicate this in the caption.</p> <p>FILTERS: We allow filters on photographs. We ask that you please include a description of how the style was achieved and which filter or technique was used. Use discretion, however, as overprocessing can often make the photo look cartoonish.</p> <p>WATERMARKS: Your Shot always credits the author of a photo whenever and wherever it appears on the site, along with providing a link to the author's profile. Because of this, there's no need to watermark your photo. A small and subtle watermark is allowed but not encouraged—we want to see your photograph without any distractions.</p> <p>Thanks in advance &amp; happy shooting:):)</p>",

Whether it’s a rock formation in the Southwest or a single wildflower in the Northeast, his eye captures the natural beauty of nature in a clean and vibrant way. In addition to his passion for the details and geometry that nature provides, Bob’s other passion is studying the artistic details of architecture and the automobile. He has captured those details by just shooting specific areas, never the entire building or vehicle.</p> <p>For more information and images, go to his website: <a href=""https://bobpauldingphoto.com/bob_paulding_profile.php"" class=""linkified"">https://bobpauldingphoto.com/bob_paulding_profile.php</a>.</p>",

Equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries, it was established in 1789 as the nation's first executive department.<br/>The State Department is headquartered in the Harry S Truman Building, a few blocks away from the White House, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Its duties include implementing the foreign policy of the United States, operating the nation's diplomatic missions abroad, negotiating treaties and agreements with foreign entities, and representing the United States at the United Nations.<br/>The State Department is led by the Secretary of State, a member of the Cabinet who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition to administering the Department, the Secretary of State serves as the nation's chief diplomat and representative abroad.</p> <p>Diplomatic Reception Rooms:<br/>The Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the U.S. Department of State constitute forty-two principal rooms and offices where the Secretary of State conducts the business of modern diplomacy. Located on the seventh and eighth floors of the Harry S Truman Building in Washington, D.C., the Diplomatic Reception Rooms contain one of the nation’s foremost museum collections of American fine and decorative arts.</p> <p>__________________________________________________</p> <p>EVENT DETAILS - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!</p> <p>Registration: As this is a limited space event there is a $11.95 per person registration fee to reduce the number of people that RSVP and then “no show,” which prevents others from participating.

Game. On.</p> <p>If you don't know, now you know...</p> <p>If you've never played the game of kickball as a kid you must have grown up on Mars. But as a quick primer, it's a game with rules similar to baseball -- except instead of using a bat to hit a little ball, you use your feet to kick a ball about 10x the size of a baseball. Kick the ball, run to the base, avoid getting your ball caught mid-air or yourself tagged out. Easy. And no athletic skill is necessary, just the ability to kick! Go out and practice now to get ready. Kick the postman when he delivers your bills. Kick that neighbor who won't turn down his stereo. Just get kicking!</p> <p>If you haven't played the game in 20 years, here are the general rules we will be using <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf"" class=""linkified"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64476072/Kickball%20Rules.pdf</a></p> <p>A $3.00 organization fee will be collected at this event, your host is in the running for hardest working person on meetup.</p> <p>The important stuff...</p> <p>• This is a co-ed game so ladies don't be shy to sign up. And it doesn't matter if you have no athletic ability, you just have to be willing to have a little fun.</p> <p>• Dress for physical activity! You'll be kicking and running so wear your sneaks, shorts and a t-shirt.</p> <p>• Rain or similar un-favorable weather cancels the meetup. Not!</p> <p>• Check the meetup site before leaving for last minute updates as well as my mobile phone number.</p> <p>• Please DO NOT RSVP if you do not seriously plan to attend as space is limited. No flakes allowed! If you RSVP and I notice that you have a number of no shows or have a history of last minute cancellations, you will be removed.</p>",

If you are new to the group, Welcome ( : This group is for anyone interested in photography, regardless of your skill level or what you choose to photograph with. The people in this group are fantastic, welcoming, and willing to share their knowledge. Each month we having a meeting at the Appleton Public Library where we share ideas, talk about photography, and about the monthly challenges. Below is what we'll be talking about this month.</p> <p>I will be in Idaho so Gary will be my taking my place in leading this meeting. Treat him just as amazingly as you all treat me ( :</p> <p>May's discussion will be: ""An Urban Love Affair.""</p> <p>What would you do photographically if someone hired you and said:</p> <p>""Get me some pictures of your favorite places in your town. I want to create a guide book that will attract tourists. I want to see icons of the community. I want them to be interesting. Provocative. Even a bit controversial. The images can be people, places or things. Most of all, I want them to be different from the status quo. I want them to evoke an emotional response of the viewer such that they will want to come to your town.""</p> <p>Henri Cartier-Bresson was a master of this. Some might call it ""street photography,"" but he called it ""The Decisive Moment."" It is a moment when the subject is composed and framed by connecting the minds eye to the eyes of the heart.</p> <p>We will be discussing these concepts at the May meeting.</p> <p>Challenges: Each month I put forth a photography challenge. The idea being to get you out doing photography and trying new things.<br/>The challenge for May is to create the ""Urban Love Affair"" portfolio. Submit your BEST images (1-3) by posting them to the May Challenge folder. I will bring in some images to get you inspired and excited to create photographs. You will have until the July meeting to photograph this challenge.</p> <p>The last challenge given in March, the Creative Live Challenge: Motion blur, bracketing, sandwich bag portraits, water droplets, holiday light bokeh, or car trails, will viewed at this meeting. Here's the link to view the videos. <a href=""https://www.creativelive.com/class/creative-photography-challenge"" class=""linkified"">https://www.creativelive.com/class/creative-photography-challenge</a> (this video is free if you sign up for creative live) Please make sure to add 1 or 2 images to the March Photography Monthly album so that we can look at the images you made. Besides allowing us to get through everyone's images choosing only 1-2 photographs also challenges you to pick your very best work from a session or outing. Only 1 image will be shown during the meeting.</p> <p>We'll be meeting in Meeting Room A on the lower level of the Appleton Public Library at 6:30pm. When you go in the main entrance to the library take the stairs on your right down to the lower level. I look forward to seeing you and the new work you've created!!</p>",

Being able to print with a great degree of consistency and accuracy saves you time, frustration, and money.</p> <p>The old adage, ""WYSIWYG"" (What You See Is What You Get) readily applies when you are properly color-managed. John Watts will show you the 3 steps to successful Color Management and how to implement these into your Photoshop workflow, in a style that even the most die-hard ""non-techie"" can enjoy and understand</p> <p>2) Editing for Success (1/2 Hour):</p> <p>The second part of this Meetup will focus on the concepts of proper image editing.</p> <p>So, you just got back from a photo shoot, and you've got all these wonderful images - now what? How do you properly edit all of your images, pick the best ones, and then make the most out of them using Photoshop?</p> <p>When it comes to a good final image, it's important to be a tough ""self-editor"" of your images, then knowing what you're aiming for before you can properly use the tools in Photoshop.</p> <p>The cost to attend is $5 for this 90 minute Meetup, payable when you RSVP online.</p> <p>A useful handout will be provided. Please note that in the interest of time, the focus will be on proper Color Management and Editing practices, rather than other mechanics, functions, and tools of Photoshop.</p> <p>This low-cost workshop is designed primarily for those fairly new to Photoshop, but it is also a good ""refresher"" course in the basics for those with a bit more experience. As this presentation is in a “seminar” format (via a digital projector), bringing your laptop is NOT recommended, due to limited space and time. Questions encouraged - I'll provide bottled water - Let's have some fun!</p> <p>RSVP now to assure a seat - We should be finished up by 8:30 PM - See you there!</p> <p>John Watts :-)</p> <p>Watts Digital Imaging (<a href=""http://www.wattsdigital.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.wattsdigital.com/</a>)</p>",

It is widely regarded as one of the most efficient and effective cardio and strength building workouts today.</p> <p>Cardio/Calorie Benefits</p> <p>Burn more calories climbing stairs. It engages the body’s largest muscle groups to repeatedly lift your body weight up, step after step. Using your largest muscles to carry your own weight uphill is far superior to exercising on a flat treadmill when it comes to work performed and calories burned.</p> <p>Strength and Muscle Toning Benefits</p> <p>The simple act of maintaining balance engages core muscles with every step, building strength and endurance . Tone and sculpt your entire lower body. Stair climbing engages every major muscle in your lower body as many as 120+ times/minute: glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps and calves. High repetitions are famous for building lean muscle and burning fat which results in toned and sculpted muscles. You can achieve high work efforts while moving at very low speeds relative to other workout options, minimizing the toll/stress on the body.</p>",

Por un lado, el desarrollo cronológico de la obra de Tanit Plana, que incluye nuevas lecturas de las primeras series, como ""Violència aplicada"" [masked]).

Larry says “it was certainly a trip worthy of having been on my bucket list.""</p> <p>Terri Watson will present on Photographing Action. Whether you want to photograph sports, wildlife, the family pet, or street photography there are three basic principles of action photography: 1) Stopping or freezing the subject in action 2) Slowing the action down only to a point of clarity and intrigue and 3) Panning with the movement of your subject. Terri will cover what to think about to get the effect you want and then translate this thought process to the appropriate camera settings, lens choice, composition, and lighting considerations.</p> <p>About our speakers:<br/>Larry’s a retired Lockheed Martin software engineer who began photography with a Kodak Brownie at an early age thru the late 1960’s. A trip to Alaska helped Larry get back into film photography and to experience digital photography with a 1MB Kodak camera. Larry has traveled to Hawaii, Alaska, the Canadian Rockies, Iceland, and the Galapagos Islands.</p> <p>Terri’s photography focus is on shooting domestic animals and wildlife. She has led safaris to Tanzania for 5+ years during the Wildebeest migration so others can experience the Serengeti, a “place like no other on earth.” This December, Terri plans to add optional Gorilla Trekking excursions and having lived in the Middle East, a pass-through Qatar.</p> <p>PHOTO SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT: Flash - Open Category.

Meeting locations change, so email [masked].</p> <p>How much local music do you hear on the San Diego airwaves?<br/>Corporate radio would have you believe that we live in a local music desert!</p> <p>The truth is that San Diego has a vibrant community of local musicians and artists, but commercial radio has all but ignored local talent. Not surprising because many San Diego stations are programmed out of corporate headquarters with the same playlist as doled out in Idaho and Maine. Shame on them!</p> <p>KNSJ 89.1 FM intends to revolutionize the airwaves. KNSJ is community radio and wants to change the cultural landscape with alternative programming while supporting local artists and their listeners. KNSJ pledges to play more local bands and artists than all the rest of San Diego's radio stations combined.</p> <p>KNSJ intends to focus on creative and socially conscious music. John Legend, in accepting the Oscar for best song, reminded us that ""it's an artist’s duty to reflect the times we're in,""... "" the struggle for justice is right now."" KNSJ wants to create a cultural revolution of hope, of optimism, of love and ire... inspiring collective action to save the planet. While some music is created as escapism, other music becomes anthems for consciousness and change.</p> <p>KNSJ’s Local Music Summits bring together local DJs, music producers, musicians and show hosts to talk about transforming the airwaves with new local radio shows and podcasts. KNSJ’s current local shows include Sonic Sundowner with Benjamin Cossel and Train of Thought Podcast with Gill Sotu. The expectation is that the Local Music Summits will spawn a dozen other music shows from hip-hop to folk, reggae to Blues, Latin, Asian, African and Worldbeat. Many of these programs will feature interviews and insights into the musicians and their creative process as they minister through their music. The expectation is that more local music on the air will result in a growing appreciation of local cultural treasures and in time will result in larger audiences allowing for more musicians being able to sustain themselves through their craft. KNSJ looks towards the day when it becomes a clearing house for local music. KNSJ expects to host live music on the air, and co-sponsor concerts and festivals where there is a convergence of many of the performing arts including spoken word and dance. These music events will in turn support the community radio station, which depends on individual donations for its future growth.</p> <p>Local musicians wanting to get their talent on the air can post their music on KNSJ at <a href=""http://knsj.org/music/"" class=""linkified"">http://knsj.org/music/</a></p> <p>Listen Up: No matter where you are you can listen to KNSJ.org or use the TuneIn radio app or find us on iTunes.</p> <p>For more information contact: [masked] or call[masked].</p>",

You can see it from space. But I'm amazed a lot of people living here have never seen it from Earth - up close. Here's your chance. We'll be staying one mile from the South Rim and, are you ready for something a little different? Yes, we will be camping, but you can also choose to stay in a cabin. So if you don't like sleeping in a tent, this is the trip for you.</p> <p>PRIVATE LOCATION: This is a unique opportunity: I've reserved a cabin for 3 nights -- our location is very private. Usually at the Grand Canyon, you're in a bland hotel or a crowded campground. But we have this entire property all to ourselves. And yet we're only a mile from the rim of the Canyon. Our location allows us to explore the whole area. Take a look at the photos of the place. Awesome, isn't it?</p> <p>Its sort of like going back to the past; this is a pioneer cabin from the<br/>1890's -- it looks like it could be in a Western movie. But its been updated<br/>with a fridge and stove and the property has bathrooms and a shower room.</p> <p>We did this trip last year -- it was incredible. The only thing I would have changed was: it was Memorial Day so it was a little warm and a little crowded. So this time, we're going earlier in May. Problem solved. This is the PERFECT time to go.</p> <p>We'll use the cabin as a base to explore the whole area. We'll spend some quality time at the Canyon. There will be hikes. (We will NOT be doing the Rim to Rim hike. It's not that kind of trip.) We'll watch the Sunset over the Canyon. Hell, we're so close I'm thinking it might be cool to get up early one morning and walk through the woods in the dark and watch the Sun RISE over the Canyon too.</p> <p>Nearby is a small lake that's supposed to be a great place for evening<br/>wildlife viewing; deer, antelope and javelina (wild desert pigs) hang out there.</p> <p>We'll also be doing some road trippin' in the area. HORSESHOE BEND. MAYBE Antelope Canyon. Details to come.</p> <p>: READ RSVP INSTRUCTIONS BELOW :<br/>Most attendees on past trips are in the 25-40 age range.</p> <p>CABIN or CAMPING<br/>So you have a choice: We have the cabin and we'll also be tent camping on the property. The cabin has limited space -- there is bed space for only 8 people. The first people to complete the process (RSVP w/email address, respond to survey, and pay) get first shot at the spaces in the cabin. (You can, of course, choose tent camping if you wish). You specify your preference in your reply to my survey.</p> <p>COST for 3 nights: Camping: $110 per person / Cabin: $195 per person<br/>DON'T WAIT until the last minute: the fee will go up by $25/ Camping and $50/Cabin on April 9 - one month before the trip.</p> <p>Two large tents are available for use, or bring your own tent. Cups, plates, utensils are supplied. Cooking gear, including pots, skillets, 3 stoves, etc are also available for you to use. You supply your own food (mostly) but I will cook up dinner one night and one morning I'll make my famous blueberry pancakes</p> <p>CAMPFIRE TIME: HANGING OUT<br/>When night falls, we'll eat and drink, and hang around the cabin fireplace or the outside fire ring. Maybe play games, tell stories, get to know each other. For some, this is their favorite part of the trip.</p> <p>GETTING THERE<br/>Leave on Thur or early Fri morning.<br/>Carpooling is required - you coordinate thru a carpool tool I link to. You split gas cost and the $30 park entrance fees (though a lot of people have the Parks Pass, which makes the entrance free.)</p> <p>RSVP INSTRUCTIONS<br/>I want to make sure you're prepared will be ready to go. So once you RSVP I'll email you a short survey/questions which you need to return to me (So don't forget to give me your email address when you RSVP.) And you won't officially be on the trip until you're confirmed and pay. There will be people going from different Meetup groups so the RSVP's you see here show you an incomplete picture.</p> <p>Remember, as always: No Dogs, No Kids and No Bad Attitudes.</p>",

This can lead to a pretty photograph as we try and show the subject in the best light. However, it is possible to make your image more meaningful with personal interpretation. In this presentation, Nikhil will discuss how you can identify your inspiration and create images that communicate that personal connection, through interpretation.</p> <p>Nikhil Bahl is a full time professional photographer, author, educator and and environmentalist residing in the Washington D.C. area. Drawing continuous inspiration from nature, Nikhil adopts novel approaches and seeks meaningful interpretations: to create photographs that transcend the commonplace, reflect deeper insights, and convey an enchantment of the subject’s beauty.</p> <p>An offshoot of Nikhil's fine art photography and love of nature is his documentation of wildlife behaviors and habitats. As a volunteer with the National Park Service and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, his goal is to portray environmental stories with an artistic appeal, so his photographs educate and motivate about the imperative of conservation.</p> <p>Each year Nikhil leads numerous photography tours and instructional workshops in the United States and abroad. His teaching encourages participants to advance beyond ordinary photos and develop their own style and vision. Nikhil is a popular speaker at photography clubs, expos and industry events. He authored the acclaimed ebook, Creative Interpretations and writes articles on the creative and technical aspects of photography. His work can be viewed at www.nikhilbahl.com.</p>",

How we manage conflict can make or break our day. This class is for anyone who would like to learn how to practice becoming a radiator of peace in moments of conflict. When we feel peaceful and calm within, we open the doors for better communication and feelings of well-being to emerge, not only for ourselves but for all parties involved.</p> <p>In this workshop you will learn:</p> <p>* How to connect to your “objective observer,” the one who notices without reacting.</p> <p>* The Five Common Styles of “Doing Conflict” and how to meet each one with a peaceful response</p> <p>* How to Move From Conflict to Communication</p> <p>About our Guest Speaker: Erin Ramos is a teacher and energy healing practitioner who has spent the past 16 years studying the art of purposeful conflict through the study of energy dynamics and Non-Violent Communication. Erin has had lots of practice managing conflict, up close and personal, with her own family of four. She has noticed how managing her own energy during conflict helps the other party/parties to relax into healing conversations.

Every photographer gets individual shoot time of around 10-15 minutes on each of the 2 sets. This may vary slightly depending on the specifics of each shoot.</p> <p>These are peer guided, photo club style shoots, we have and encourage photographers of ALL experience levels attend. A studio photographer attends every shoot to assist new photographers and guide the smooth running of the shoot. Many shoots have a stylist, HMUA or even a collaborating brand.</p> <p>We ask photographers to tag the studio, club, models and any stylist when posting photos from the shoots. This generates some great networking and collaboration between everyone involved.</p> <p>Our shoots are great experience and portfolio builders in a relaxed friendly and supportive environment. Many photographers attend several sessions each month.</p> <p>Goto Facebook.com/groups/JunglePhotoClub on Facebook for the themes list and bookings and to share your photos with the club members and models.</p>",

Wynn considers wings as a symbol of freedom, truth and justice. The only species that are free to cross the Southern border today are those with wings. Inspired by wing span murals, painted by urban street artists, Wynn considered it ideal to create an interactive art show inside a gallery setting. Viewers can participate by standing in front of oversized life-like bird, butterfly and angel wings to have their photo taken to be shared on social media. This interactive show is dedicated to groups such as Border Angels, Charter for Compassion and Roving Medical Unit. These volunteers assist migrants by trekking water stations into the deserts along migrant paths, administer medical attention, offer legal assistance and temporary shelters. These groups also work to dispel myths that surrounding immigration in the US and that all people are received with compassion and humanity. Wynn herself migrated to the US several years ago crossing the Canadian border from the North. Now a US citizen, Wynn remembers her first 8 years as an illegal alien and is very sympathetic for all the people caught in todays situation along the Southern US-Mexico Border. 7 Arts Gallery will host Angel Wynn’s show “WINGS” with an artist reception Friday May 10, from 5-7pm. The show runs from May 3 through to May 31, 2019. 7 Arts Gallery is located 1/2 block from the Plaza at 125 Lincoln Avenue, Santa Fe, NM.

There will be a faint ""river"" of light crossing the sky. That's the Milky way. Full dark adaptation occurs after 30 minutes of not seeing any source of light, but this is not required for seeing our galaxy.</p> <p>Sample Solo Photos:</p> <p>January - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G4RflE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G4RflE</a><br/>February - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2SmF4Xh</a><br/>March - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2UBlXcW</a><br/>April (Premium location) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2WRIZKp</a><br/>April (Semi-Premium location) - <a href=""https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2WXGTsv</a><br/>May -<br/>June - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2t2jpoM</a><br/>July - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2G2ucrD</a><br/>August - (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2GglvcD"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2GglvcD</a><br/>September (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Snydwy"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Snydwy</a><br/>October (Regional Victoria) - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2Wuw55H</a><br/>November - <a href=""http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE"" class=""linkified"">http://bit.ly/2S2w7mE</a><br/>December - N/A</p> <p>We should get back to Southern Cross Station around 11:15 PM.</p> <p>Important: This group is strictly not for dating.

We prefer to overcome these challenges to the best of our abilities rather than turn anyone away.</p> <p>We will also not be visiting specific URR hiding places such as attics and cellars as for the most part those were either kept secret or have long since vanished within the city. However, we will be walking to various sites and discussing how the Underground Railroad operated throughout the DC/MD/VA region. In particular, we'll be visiting the recently installed historical markers that detail the Washington, DC slave markets and the site of the Williams Slave Jail, where Solomon Northup of ""Twelve Years a Slave"" was illegally kidnapped and held prior to being sent to Louisiana.</p> <p>________________________________________</p> <p>Registration: FREE and all are welcome including children, groups and well-behaved pets.</p> <p>Weather: The program will take place light rain (sprinkles) or shine.

Gemeinsam mit seiner Studiopartnerin Jessica Walsh liefert er mit dem neuen Ausstellungsprojekt Beauty ein ganz persönliches, visuell beeindruckendes Plädoyer für die Lust am Schönen.</p> <p>Mit spektakulären interaktiven Installationen nimmt das renommierte Designduo Sagmeister &amp; Walsh die Besucherinnen und Besucher mit auf eine sinnlich-vergnügliche Suche: Was ist Schönheit und warum fühlen wir uns von ihr angezogen?</p> <p>Anhand von zahlreichen Beispielen aus Produktdesign, Stadtplanung, Architektur und Grafikdesign möchte das Designduo demonstrieren, dass Schönes tatsächlich besser funktioniert. Unterstützt von Erkenntnissen aus der psychologischen Ästhetik, aus Geschichte, Philosophie und den Naturwissenschaften vertreten Sagmeister &amp; Walsh den Standpunkt, dass Schönheit mehr ist als eine rein oberflächliche Strategie: Sie beeinflusst unseren Alltag, stimuliert unsere Wahrnehmung und macht die Welt zu einem besseren Ort.<br/>Sagmeister &amp; Walsh: Beauty ist eine Kooperation des Museum Angewandte Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, und des MAK Wien.

His Leica M4 snapped spontaneous images of everyday people, from the Mad Men era of New York to the early years of the Women's Movement to post-Golden Age Hollywood, all while observing themes of cultural upheaval, political disillusionment, intimacy and alienation. Once derided by the critics, Winogrand's ""snapshot aesthetic"" is now the universal language of contemporary image making. Garry Winogrand: All Things are Photographable is the first cinematic treatment of Winogrand's work, including selections from the thousands of rolls of film still undeveloped upon his unexpected death in 1984. Interviews with Tod Papageorge, Matthew Weiner and more attest to Winogrand's indisputable influence, both as artist and chronicler of culture, while archived conversations with Jay Maisel highlight the gruff, streetwise perspective of ""a city hick from the Bronx."" In the tradition of Robert Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson, Winogrand's candid, psychological style transports us to a bygone world, one where image lacked the editing and control possible today.</p>",

She will cover the effects of trauma, living from passion, truth, self-inquiry, self-love and above all, Gratitude. Bring an open mind and plan to engage, as we’ll ask ourselves and each other questions, we’ll cover both challenging topics and joyful ones, all in the interest of choosing our lives and diving deep into living from a place of appreciation and abundance.</p> <p>About our Guest Speaker: KYLE HOLLINGSWORTH</p> <p>Kyle is a creative polymath, often working on many projects at once. A mother &amp; life partner, artist, designer, writer, speaker, teacher, singer/songwriter, intuitive medium, and sound healer, she lives to create and to be in service of others. She is a powerful stand for self-growth, for truth, and a passionate instigator of full self-expression.</p> <p>Kyle made her way from her home in Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles 25 years ago, never knowing this would be her place of rebirth. After living through decades of trauma and abuse, she reached a breaking point in 2009 where she had to choose whether to continue down a self-destructive path, or grab the reins and redirect herself to a more powerful way of living. She has spent the past ten years leaning into self-awareness, somatic therapy, spiritual practice, and facing the tough truths about the story she’d been living.</p> <p>Now, her passion is to share her experience and the wisdom she has gained through tools and lessons we can all use to live a new story. For her, it starts with gratitude. She has currently written over 1320 consecutive days of gratitude posts - a daily practice that has created a huge shift in her life. She is completing her memoir this year, and hopes to have it published by 2020. She is committed to sharing her story and inspiring others to embrace their birthright to live fully and fearlessly.</p> <p>www.kyle-creative.com</p> <p>Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kylecreative/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.instagram.com/kylecreative/</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KyleCreativeArt/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.facebook.com/KyleCreativeArt/</a></p> <p>Blog: <a href=""https://medium.com/@kylehollingsworth"" class=""linkified"">https://medium.com/@kylehollingsworth</a></p> <p>Songwriter / Vocalist / Sound Healer, Myuna Music<br/>www.myunamusic.com</p> <p>Suggested donation is: $10</p>",

May 11th-12th in Shenandoah National Park is Wildflower weekend. Big Meadows is a fantastic place to roam around and see wildlife and flora that comes out in Spring time. Sun rise is around 6:05 am this morning and the light is great early in the day and there is more opportunity to catch deer grazing. We will meet at the small lot that is located next to the meadows, there is more parking across Skyline Drive at the Wayside store and restaurant. Afterwards for those that would like to go we can drive down to Dark Hollow Falls trail that starts .5 mile from Big Meadows parking. I would recommend a tripod for the meadows and waterfalls but a telephoto lens or macro might be great for the meadows as well.</p> <p>There is an entry fee to the National Park; $30 for a 7 day pass, $50 for a year pass. Fee covers everyone in the car so if you are coming up that day car pooling would help cover the cost same with gas.<br/>It is about a 2 hour drive from Richmond to the location.</p> <p>There is a campground (Opens at March 29th) at Big Meadows and can reserve sties at www.recreation.gov. There is also a lodge (Opens May 8th) that you can stay at if you wanted. Booking for that is at www.goshenandoah.com/lodging</p> <p>There are other campgrounds in the Shenandoah National Park as well as accommodations in Elkton and Luray. You can always back country camp with a free permit in the park but you have to hike in.</p> <p>Lots of information can be found on the main website, www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm</p> <p>If you have any questions about this or have interest in spending more time up there planning a trip, I can help with that as well with trails and other places in the area that we could go to after Dark Hollow Falls.</p> <p>Notes: Big Meadows is a large meadows right off Skyline Drive in Shenandoah Nation Park. Some of the trails that weave through the meadows are wet to as much as 4 inches of water. I recommend comfortable shoes but ones that you don't mind getting wet. There are some great shots from the wet areas. If you are planning on doing Dark Hollow falls after it is a 1.4 mile round trip to the falls going down the mountain and then back up. Don't over exert yourself as it is a 440 ft elevation gain and can be steep in spots.</p>",

Nestled in the heart of Bommer Canyon is part of the old Irvine Ranch Cattle Camp. Some of the original structures exist today, adding to the rustic feel of the Canyon.

Otherwise, for R10 you can park across the road from the Old Biscuit Mill at the College of Cape Town.. (entrance in Kent St).</p> <p>After the tour, if you wish, we can all gather and share our images together with a nice plate of food at the Market.
